->india nuclear doctrine

For a credible deterrent, constancy of doctrine in its core essentials has definite merit

For India, nuclear deterrence is defensive and a means to secure its sovereignty and security. Its strategy of assured retaliation, combined with “no first use,” provides adequate guarantee for this purpose. The strategy was unveiled concurrently with its 1998 nuclear tests, which ended the determined U.S. bid to prevent India from acquiring nuclear deterrent. Ironically, India’s nuclear weapons tests, together with the rapid expansion of its economy, transformed its global outlook and relations with the U.S. and the world.

The Chinese nuclear weapons test of 1964, on the heels of the 1962 war, had always rankled in Indian minds. K. Subrahmanyam and K.R. Narayanan, at the time in the early years of their public service, advocated a matching Indian response. This did not then have resonance at the top, as India was facing the twin crises of food and finance.

The P-5 states treated non-proliferation as their default foreign and security policy objective, but this was invariably trumped by national interest. India’s restraint and decision not to weaponise its nuclear capacities after the 1974 test were well known. Yet, when Pakistan accelerated its nuclear proliferation, it was not stopped in the wake of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, when U.S. President Jimmy Carter designated Pakistan a “frontline” state.

The Chinese transferred nuclear materials and technology to Pakistan, including the weapons design and the means to deliver them — the solid fuel 300-kilometre range M-11 ballistic missiles. In a paper published in 1972, Professor Wayne Wilcox of Colombia University, then working as cultural attaché in the U.S. Embassy in London, perceptively recognised that India’s policy concerning China and Pakistan “is to hedge all bets and cover all contingencies.” India was compelled to acquire nuclear weapons to deter nuclear blackmail in its contiguity.

Unlike Pakistan or Israel, India could not have a “recessed” deterrent or bomb in the basement, given India’s governance practices. Contingent factors delayed India’s nuclear weapons tests, such as the persistent external pressure on India, and arguments by internal agnostics who claimed that such testing would betray India’s long-held principles, diminish its international standing, and reduce future GDP growth rates by up to two per cent annually. In 1995 came the perpetual extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, without linking it to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. The conditions attached to the 1996 Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, which could foreclose India’s nuclear weapons option, became the final point of conviction. From then on, the question was not whether to test but when.

For India today, the choice is clear, as it was in 1998: so long as nuclear weapons exist, India’s nuclear deterrence will have to be maintained. Until there is a global compact for creating a nuclear weapon-free world, India will have to persevere with this policy.

What is credible deterrence?

In delivering the message of credible deterrence, all nuclear weapons states, including those that have embraced no first use, face a conundrum. Nuclear weapons are weapons of the last resort, fundamentally different from conventional weapons. War is a traditional tool of statecraft, but the weapon to end all wars cannot be a standard instrument of an ordinary war — it can only be the final recourse for dissuasion. It cannot be chance, for then it will fail to deter. While embracing a declaratory policy to avoid nuclear war, the state concerned must simultaneously demonstrate that it has nuclear war fighting capacity — the resilience to take the pain of a first strike, and both the ability and resolve to inflict massive and intolerable destruction on the attacker.

For improving its punitive capacity, China is seeking a sea-based nuclear deterrent, deploying mobile solid-fuel missiles, and moving missiles below the surface in elaborate tunnels in mountainous terrain, undetectable from space, called the “Underground Great Wall.” The same motivation has led India to similar pursuits. India’s missile force, the weak link in its deterrence, is under rapid repair. Its transformation is enabling the shift toward strategic deterrence. In the past half-dozen years, India has invested in improving the command, control, communications, and intelligence systems and its second strike capacity, including the survival of the decision-making structure. The National Command Authority deserves credit for this. Simultaneously, the sea-based leg of the triad of delivery systems is taking shape — even if at a slower pace than the situation warrants. India might also have to do more to communicate effectively that its deterrent carries credibility.

In popular domestic imagination, India’s assurance of “credible minimum deterrence” is confused with minimum credible deterrence, as if it connotes an arbitrary limitation. The essential prerequisite for nuclear deterrence is as much the sufficiency of the retaliatory capacity as the surety of response. This hinges on the size and nature of the arsenal and delivery systems, their survivability in the event of a pre-emptive attack, and the realisation by a potential adversary that the costs of attack outweigh the gains.

All nuclear weapons states that have robust missile programmes retain their first strike capabilities, since conventional missiles of short and intermediate ranges can be mated equally with nuclear or non-nuclear warheads, and can be used to attack nuclear facilities. At times doubts arise about the “responsible” behaviour of certain states, such as when Chinese President Xi Jinping did not mention China’s no first use doctrine in a defence policy speech delivered in December 2012 to the Second Artillery Corps, or when the Chinese Defence White Paper, released in April 2013, did not contain the standard reiteration of this doctrine, thereby creating doubts about a shift in its nuclear policy.

While India remains watchful, most P-5 states appear to be settling into a more stable deterrence, discounting first strike weapons, despite holding a range of nuclear weaponry and delivery mechanisms. Under the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the U.S. and USSR had agreed to eliminate their intermediate and shorter range missiles between 500 and 5,500 kilometres. Pakistan alone is going in the other direction.

Myth of flexible response

The U.S. and Russia did contemplate flexible response and limited use of nuclear weapons in specific theatres in the hope of containing damage to their homelands. A graduating use of nuclear weapons is not possible, except in theory books and planning exercises. Envisaging escalatory nuclear weapons exchanges is even more difficult in India’s security context: here, the space and time span between launch and delivery is non-existent. “Controlled” nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia is hard to imagine. Between India and China, or between India and Pakistan, it is impossible.

Admittedly, nuclear weapons can be used for coercion, but up to a point, and with some success only against a non-nuclear state. The experience of Kargil 15 years ago demonstrated how the leaders of the Pakistan Army took the wrong lesson from deterrence. They believed that with the advantage of stealth and shock, they could upset the conventional status-quo, without inviting an effective riposte for fear of a nuclear exchange. This was a serious miscalculation, as they discovered to their cost. Changing India’s defensive nuclear doctrine to complicate their calculus will be irresponsible. India can survive a first strike but Pakistan cannot. What incentive would Pakistan have to consider a second strike if it believed India could attack it first? As for the growing non-nuclear threats to security, India can meet them by augmented conventional preparedness, hardened defences, upgraded equipment and a strong indigenous armament industry.

Toward a more secure India

The foremost threat to Indian security today comes not from its nuclear posture or externally, but from social deprivation and anaemic economic growth. Unshackling its entrepreneurship, accelerating infrastructure development and regenerating growth will make India safer. There is a clear vision in India on what has to be done. The new government should focus on how best and quickly to do it.

As Shyam Saran, Chairman of the National Security Advisory Board, has said, it would be best to put to rest any further speculation of a change in India’s nuclear weapons policy. For a credible deterrent, constancy of doctrine in its core essentials has definite merit. The Bharatiya Janata Party has embraced the national inheritance on no first use. India’s nuclear deterrent can be made more robust, meanwhile, by continuing the work to guarantee the efficacy of its retaliatory strike.

->VijayNagar Temple Architecture

--Additions---------------------------------
-Why land act required
-> government/private company purchasing private land for “public purpose“ but 1894 land qcquistion act don't clearly define the term pulic purpose. so it was misued to forcefully acquire the land.

Steps to be taken
-increase ease of doing business rank
-Step up manufacturing sector
-reforms to turn rep tape into red carpet
-Adopting zero defect with zero effect policy.
-Liberalizing FDI norms to enable more foreign investment

-They praised the intermixing of long distance communications methods like postal service  as well as economic activities with the Indian culture. 
-Unpleasant side of the contemporary culture like slavery system, lower status of women, large socio-economic differences did not attract their attention much perhaps due to their familiarity of such issues


European
-Contrary to this, European travellers highlighted the negative aspect of the Indian culture 
-so much that sometimes they even presented a distorted picture with their self-contrary facts
-Exacerbation of Indian cultural tapestry emerged as hypocrisy of their thought process
-They
depicted Indian culture inferior to European culture in general by focusing on evils like practice of Sati, oppressions by urban elites and kings, dependency of majority for subsistence, mass poverty etc
-Nonetheless they were amused by the dexterity of Indian artisans and presented opulent picture of Indian merchants stealthily also.

-> push to GDP as repo rate may come down
->Boost to Auto sector
->Oil and GAs sector PSU can improve its finance

->Demerits
-May increase road congesions

We importing around 80% of our crude so benefits will definatly overshoots the cons.But we should act responsibily so that if price bounce back it don't jeopardise our economy as a whole.

->Global Depository Report
-GDR are bank certificate issued in more than 1 company for share of forein company.
-The shares are held by a foreign branch of an international bank
-The shares trade as domestic shares in the domestic stock exchang, but are offered for sale globally through the various bank branches
-Prices of global depositary receipt are based on the values of related shares, but they are traded and settled independently of the underlying share
-Gernally 1 GDR = 10 Underlying share by any ration can be used.
-Used by private companies to raise capital denominated in either U.S. dollars or euros

Black Money Angle
-the companies have shown having raised funds without actually involving the real investors
-companies show fictitious business dealings and several bank accounts are used before the money reaches the final beneficiaries
- inflating the size of business transactions without making any real profits
-Used for round tripping of money. i.e bring back black money into sytem.

->Urban Area counting rules

-> Standard rules are population and density

->Indian way is
- population >500
-Density - Atleast 400 people/ sq km
- Not more than 25% of male population depending on agriculture.


Due to 3rd clause it is said that indian count of urban area is under estimated(31%) which may have some detrimental effect on our planning and policies.

->Muncipal Bonds
-Also know as Munis is a tax saving investment offered to raise fund by the local municality bodies for local area development purpose
-In lieu of smart city project GOI has proposed to use Munis in selected cities.

Benefits
-Alternate option of fund raising.
-As people money used for their area development so they will feel involved
-Will save tax
-Ear 8% interest , so safe investment -> keep people away from ponzy schemes like Sharda chit fund.
->Less pressure on centre/state govt.
->Make development process more effective as will involve locals

Limitation
-Lack of professional fund managers
- less people want to investment as other alternate with higher return 
-Lack of trust in them due to poor track records.

Plan followed
-Some Tier 2 and tier 3 cities to be identified to raise fund.
-issue fixed no of bonds to 75% of munci populations , interest - 8% , period - 3 yrs , FCFS basis
-Issuing authority to fund minimum 20% of total cost.If minimum subscription not achieved must refund to the applicants within 12 days
-Depending on its success same model can be followed for other cities too.


->-organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) [MRLs (maximum residue limits)]
- included under a group of toxic compounds called persistent organic pollutants (POPs) as their concentration increase along the food chain.,
-UN Environment Framework through the Stockholm convention on POPs, listed 12 organochlorine pesticides(as they are bio degradable) as POPs .
-All of these were tested in the latest JNU study and found to exist beyond maximum residual levels in Delhi’s vegetables
-retained in the atmosphere, soil, water and in the vegetables for very long periods

-reasons of use
- Ban on toxic products only on paper
-If people are poor they will continue to buy these product
-People go for cheap pesticides available in market
-lack of awareness about pesti and their ill effects
-Very less laboratory available for sample testing.
-Pesticide are usually applied as spray and improper product processing after harvest will let pesticide stay
-Pollution of soil and air have made plants less resistant to pest which leads to blatant use of pesticides

-implications
- POPs persist in human body and can cause chronic and long term health effects
- POPs are B2 class carcinogen i.e.,they can cause human cancers
-Since POPs in agri-products are consumed in macro-scale, the ill-health effect can reach an epidemic sort of level
-cause cancer and other health risks, including symptoms like vomiting and dizziness
-

-More international co-operation and expose black money encourager banks at international level
-Transparent funding of the political parties and bring them under RTI
-Stringent audit norms for private firms to avoid under reporting of profit.

- New monitory policy compel RBI to keep inflation level below 6 and between 6 and 4.
-But RBI inflation rate of 4-6% looks practical and indicate that we don't want stable price growth and not deflation led growth.
-this is gernally followed in advance economy where food and fuel ratio is less around 20% but in Indian CPI it is 50%
-So keeping the inflation low might hurt the farmer as it will involve below steps
	-Restrain on the MSP so keep the prices low
	-Dumping of the low cost grains
	-Export restrictions

+ve side
-People will have more money in hand to spend -> boost economy
-Saving rate will increase -> more money for investment
-Will help common people and marginal farmers who depends on market for daily needs
-RBI will get enough elbow room to cut rates.
-GDP will grow -> more FDI -> more FII -> more jobs -> less poverty

So a bine balance b/w farmer income and saving is to be maintained for stable and inclusive economy growth.

->Repo Rate Cut Effects
-Ve
- More demands to inflation may go up
-May lead to sub prime crisis as happened in US 2008
-May add up to banks NPA as it will be doling out more loan
-Less interest in saving acct urge people to spend more or save somewhere else. gernally done in gold which effect economy negatively. Rupee may depreciate -> costly crude oil import ->high fuel bill for common man

+ve
- Low EMI , more loan available

->What is e-cigarettes?
It is a battery powered electronic device resembling a cigarette which gives a feel of
smoking. It does not contain any tobacco but it uses a chemical nicotin in liquid form. A tiny atomizer is attached inside the device to convert this liquid into vapor. So they produce aerosol not smoke. (diagram needed)

How do they differ from conventional cigarettes?
1. Do not contain tobacco
2. Do not produce smoke
3. Ejects lesser amount of free radicals (about one-hundredth of conventional ones)
4. Lesser nicotin content
Potential health risks:
a) Although in much lesser quantity, it still emits free radicals which damage DNA and other molecules within cells resulting in cell death.
b) Nicotine intake from this cigarette is similar to that of conventional ones.
c) Recent research has confirmed that it weakens the immunes system in the lungs and makes them more susceptible for respiratory diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD)
d) WHO claims it to be effective in quitting smoking habit.

->Defence Procurement policy 2013

Aim : to develop indigenization of defence sector.It has adopted a hierarchy of procurement for any defence equipment
1.Buy India- Any defence equipment should be first sought from an Indian vendor and the product should have 30% indigenous content by cost
2.Buy and make (Indian)-The technology can be brought from abroad but manufacturing in India
3.Make (India)-The whole technology and development from ground up is done in India
4.Buy and Make -The technology is brought from abroad and the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) can select an Indian production partner for manufacturing.
5.Buy (global)-Buy entire component from abroad with no technology transfer.

Made in India versus Make in India
In "Made in projects" both technology development and manufacturing happens in India but in "Make in India" technology development happens abroad and we buy the technology and manufacture it in India. Now in the question of who manufactures in India give rise to two classification-Buy and Make (Indian) and Buy and make

Buy and Make (Indian)
Here the manufacturer is an Indian company.Since the manufacturing is based on technology from abroad ,manufacturing process face restrictions and the company can't optimize the cost and the company faces risk when upgraded technology reaches the market .However in case of Made in India projects cost could be optimized and more jobs could be made available.

Buy and Make 
Here the manufacturer is the original equipment manufacturer with an Indian partner.Here even the profits on manufacturing will accrue mostly to country of abroad manufacturer.The "made in project" will not only save up the precious defence budget and will enable innovation to flourish in the long run .Made in India projects will lead to technology development in India and defence exports of will flourish and India can balance trade deficit in defence sector

Defence _PSU
->2014 defence budget is 2.1% of GDP. in 2009 it was 2.9%
->India is biggest importer of the arms.
Effect on preparedness:
->  Being import dependent is putting national security in danger . A parleyment committ report has revealed that we are quite short of defence equipments inclusing the basics one
->In kargit shortage of ammunation could have been cost heavily had ISraeil not provided the required supply.
->Indian Air force is running short of squadron to counter china/Pak . We are waiting since long to get the Rafel fighter jets added to our fleet.
->Imports left less money to be spend on local RND and domestic production capabilities.

->Our PSU has not successed much in developing modern day equipment except Navy. Reasons are below
-Economic Reason : Gernally less funds are allocated to PSU as most of allocation is consumed by salary and import bill. One Rank One pension will increase this load.
-> constant reduction in budget - > Defence allocation reduced from 2.9% of GDP to 2.1% in 2014
->Lack of RND Base : Not much efforts are spend on the RND to bring some original ideas. They largely depends upon foreign bought technologies except few cases
->Talent Crunch - Labour productivity is low and best of mind dont joins to PSU owing to lackluster growth perspective.
->Lack of strict supervision : PSU keep missing deadlines on daily basis without anyone held accountable for same.

->Navy domestic prod has been fruitful owing to :
-INS construction which was helped by vast shipyards like Cochin and Manglore Shipyards.
-They started working on Transfer of Tech project earlier which helped them to develop tech expertisse.
-Navy was given priority to check increasing Chines influence in Indian Ocean
-Role of Navy in 1971 win played a key role to reshape the thinking about navy development plan.



->NGO regulations
-NGO registered under society registration act

-Current regulation measures:
-	Renewal of registration under society registration act every 5 years.
-Annnual submission of income and expenditure.
-Foreign contribution regulation act.
-State NGO Act

Concerns
-Only 10% of 22 lach NGO filed return Dec 14 CBI report before SC regarding analysis in 20 state and 6 UT
-Some of them receive huge funds most of which stay unaacountable.
-Give rise to money laundering activities.
-Diversion of funds to unethical practices
-Terrorism angle , foreitn nations diverting funds to cause security problems
-IB report foreign fund diversion to lobby backdoor and stop indian development agends
-Tax evasion.
-Round tripping of black money
-


->Civil_liability_nuclear_damage act
-For any accident held both supplier and operator as responsible , internation standard is to held only operator not supplier. Suplier should not be held responsible once delivery is out from his part.
-section 17b(give right to recourse to operator i.e suing the supplier) places unlimited liability in terms of time and quantum on suppliers which is unacceptable to them. If an accident occurs because of a small instrument even after 50 years of installation, then the
supplier will have to pay compensation in millions.Even operator can sue vendor for any faulty equipment.
-This provision make it hard to found insurer , even if found cost of insurance become too high
-No clarity over the term Nuclear Damage
-nstead of channelising liability to operator for victims , victims can file any civil/crimal case against supplier under any indian law. (sec 46)

->insurance pool
-CLND damage act put the response of any nuclear disaster on suppliers which US suppliers was not able to swallow so to resolve this deadlock we came up with this concept of insurance pool
- a pool of insurance consisting 1500 crore(which is equivalent to upper cap on operator liability) will be created with 5 PSU including General Insurance Cop paying 750 crore and rest 750 crore will be paid by govt.
-In case of disaster maximum financial liability is 2610 crore so rest 1110 crore will be born by GOI.
-In long term GOI will set up(for remaining 1110 crore) a nuclear liability fund by leving cess for same.
-if liability is more than 2610 crore india will get the fund from Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSS fund )International.
-After paying laibility by operator (max 1500 crore) , he has right to recourse (i.e suing the supplier section 17B) to supplier if it is written in contract.

Benefits:
-Will make money readily available in case of disaster
-Will do away the conflict b/w supplier and operator
-Will open door for similar civil deal with other nations like Japan , france etc.
-Will give a sense of satisfaction to people residing near the plant.
-improve india initiative in clean energy and help to levarage nuclear technology more.
-Reduce burden on govt in case of nuclear accident.

Cons:
-Supplier go unaccounted
-Burden is being paid by indian Govt and PSU
-uppar cap limit not enough in case of big disaster.	



->Ordinance:
-A 123 empoer presi to promulgate ordinance

Example where misused
- Last govt tried to nullify SC oder of convicted politicians automatically lossiing parley membership thorough ordinace which was scrapped later.
- The promulgation of the SARFAESI Ordinance in 2002, when the bill was being deliberated by the concerned Standing Committee
-It make the governance purely executive basis setting aside the legislatures.
-undermine the supermacy of parliament
-Any law such conveyed lack the wisdom of parliament
-Improvements which could have come after discussion in parley are missed out.
-Redudce our democracy to single party syst
-Govt malafied intentions goes unchecked

+ve contri
-Help govt to check the opposition acting only for political motives.
-Help to take up the measures required in case of emergency when parley is not in session.
--Recent ordinance to 2 auction the coal and increase insurance FDI limit from 26 to 49%
- attempt to demonetize large rupee denominations in 1978 to prevent illicit money transfers
-Ancient Monument ordinance 2010 which was promulugated to meet the deadline of High court
-


->Concerns Effecting town planning in 19th centuary
->Defence
1857 mutiny compelled british to opt for a safer and well protected town

-Health
-wide spread diseases like cholera and plague forced British to opt for an archi giving importance to sanitation and hygine show the segregation of living place from dumpyards

->Racial superority
-To avoid the mingling of white with native colonies were segregated

->Trade
-To make sure easy access to British goods and raw material export town planned on strategic location.Intro of Railway in 1853 saw emergence of some new town near connectivity hubs.

->Efforts to regulate all aspects of social life
-Led to standardized rules for construction of private building and public roads.

->Revenue concerns
-To maximize reviewn put the municipality tax which led to creation of muncipal cooperation and hence new era in urbanization

Other factors
-Climate accumultization - > exa viceroy house in Shimla
-Influence of outside world on planning : Like french pondicherry etc.
-Lifestyle

->Volcanic eruption cause:
-Convergence or divergence of technotic plates
-Density difference in magma
-Release of gases
-addition of melted magma in already filled chamber
-Stressing of plate and creation of faults




->  Bangladesh’s birth with active help from India also gave birth to 2 political parties namely Awami League (Sheikh Hasina) and Bangladesh Nationalist Party(BNP, Khalida Zia). Both party were arch rival for the Leader in Legislature, 


Current problems in Bangladesh:
-n 2009, the BAL government setup the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), to try cases of war crimes by the then Pro-Pakistan volunteers called Razakar Bahini.
-The recent speedy trials to convict 1971 War crime accused resulting in even death penalties to jamat e islami leaders have played a role in aggravating the hostilities
-The jamat-e - islami played a heinous role in the murder of pro -liberation intellectuals to eliminate the new nation of leaders during the liberation war
-BNP called for a national protest against trail and in response govt organized a counter protest with opposition leaders arrested. this aggrevated the situation.
-after the 2014 election which is declared both domestic and by international media as undemocratic and forged because of the lower turnout and ghost voters. Hence BNP has boycotted the election and withdrew from the parliament leading to political deadlock as half of the assembly hall is vacant in parliament. Awami League is continuing with this fractured mandate



Bangladesh Violen’t birth in 1971 has divided Bangladesh into 2 groups one pro-pakistani which BNP is often found supporting war criminals and Jamaat-e-Islami militant indirectly which were tried and sentenced recently by AL orders. Khalida Zia party is also having many senior leaders who have leaning toward pakistan and during her tunure, India suffered major setbacks in Bangladesh infiltration, militancy and support in North East turbulency by financing and arming.

Awami League on the other hand is leaning toward India as the Party leader Sheikh Hasina’s father was decorated hero of Liberation war of 1971, hence the party was found on the base ground of liberation and not on resisting ground of liberation. Hence Awami League leaderships are found beneficial toward Indian by fruitfull talks going on Farakka Barrage, Exchange of Enclaves, checking the infiltration, handing over militant staying in Bangladesh etc.

Heath sector priority
-Quality of service
-Access to service
-Improved complimentary services like sanitation , hygine , open defacation , fossil fuel,nutrition leve environment awareness etc.
