Ocean water circulations has a major impact on the climatic and
socio-economic conditions of a country. These circulations are
episodic and zonal and are caused due to following factors:-

Temperature: Oceanic currents moves from higher temperature
to the lower temperature if other things remains constant. But if
increase in temperature causes increase in evaporation then
displacement shall take place from low temperature(where evaporation
is less) zone to high temperature zone.

Salinity: Higher density causes the oceanic water to sink
and therefore displacement starts from low saline area towards the
higher saline zone.

Density: Difference in density drives the oceanic current as
a higher density zone tends to subdued therfore current moves from
lower densuty zone to higher density zone.

Apart from these factors precipitation, pressure, and rotation of
earth also plays prominent role in driving these currents and any
change in any of the above factors can lead to disasterous
consequences.

->Tiger population
-Recent tiger population census by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) show that there has been inceesae of 30% in tiger population and india has 70% of world tigers

Critism of method used for census
-double sampling approach that combines data gathered from ground surveys and camera traps was used, it was deviced in 1938 have gone obsolete now.
-based on statistical extrapolation; hence weak and may yield flawed result.
-given the vast geography of the area, the method may not yield sufficiently refined results

To improve tiger conservation efforts: 
1. annual tiger census instead of once in four years. 
2. use advanced methods such as intensive annual monitoring using camera traps, "DNA sampling". 
3. positive attitude towards wild life services such as training them in use of latest technology. 
4. conserve natural habitat of tigers. 
5. tackle the menace of poaching effectively by involving local community.
6. Interconnect various habitant to allow the free flow of big cat.
7. Voluntary migration of people from tiger reserve area to avoid man animal conflict
8. Better managed tiger tourism



->Govt imposed an  import duty of ten per cent on gram(chana dal) and also removing export ban on pulsed and edible oils
- Till not now import duty is not levied on pulses
-Similarly, export of pulses is prohibited, except for chickpea (kabuli chana) and organically grown ones

Why import duty:
-Price of chana is sliding compared to govt MSP  which would have increased imports and hampered farmers. Import duty of 10 per was levied on gram to make Indian farmers competitive
-Export ban was lifted in pulses and edible oils to provide better income to Indian farmers.
-Farmer might get financial burden if cheap gram is imported and might give away gram cultivation.
-

Good in long run?
-> No , it might solve the probelm for short term only. Coz this might increase inflation as import gram cost will increase ,ultimately consumers has to pay more.

Solutions:
-> govt should provide better yielding seeds
->better irrigation facilities.
->Fertilizer with Pulse specific nutreints
->Farmer awareness about crop cycle ,soil understanding etc.
->Should spend more on RND to work on increasing protein contents in pulses.

Conclusion
Thus, these interventions might be needed for critical periods, but it should not be resorted frequently, and be introduced with a short term sunset clauses so that extending the policy measures requires a review each time


->NE insurgency
- Insurgency gernally called by groups who has signed ceasefire agreement with union , as it immunitize them from state forces action.
-Ceasefire agreement has following terms
 - Not moving outside designated camps (in civilized area) with uniform or arms
 -Not indulging in extortion , killing , or additional arm procurement
 -not indulging in forcefull money collection or intimidation of individuals or govt officials.

-But all these rules are flouted.

Solutions:
-> Disarmment and rehabilitation of groups who has signed ceasfire.
->  raise a common Northeast law enforcement force, which is well paid 
-> monitoring and supervision of the designated ‘cease-fire’ camps should be carried out on a monthly basis
-> updated data of those living in the camps, the weapons they possess 
->increase state administrative capabilities in remote districts with better pay structures and oversight
->Better connectivity and trade prospect
->intelligence sharing

->Indian Waterways
-share of waterway is 0.4% of total cargo handled. We have 14500 km of navigatable waterway. so underutilized

Cons:
-Disrupt habitant of aquatic beings
-Oil spills
-Danger to fishes etc.
-Water pollution through waste disposes in water.

PRoblems:
- inadequate least assured depth for cargo tranportation
-Bridges with low assured clearance.
-Meandering nature of rives
-Critical shortage of vessels required for cargo tranportation.
-inqdequate inland waterway terminal.
-Negligible intermodal connectivity.


Uses
-For bulk cargo movement , eco friendly options
-transportation without significant danger to life and nature
-can be used for coal transportation to power plants situated on river banks.Many plants expected on Ganga National Waterway 1.
-CAn be used for nortest connectivity providing edge over chicken neck corridor.
-Connecting to ports can easy congestion on roads/rail traffic.
-

->AC supply inefficient than DC
-The standard method of transmission of current in India and across all countries is in AC
 and not DC because of following reasons:
· Transmission losses in AC is less compared to DC
-Feasibility of step-up and step-down of voltage in AC [done using transformer to enable long
 distance transmission]
· AC can be transmitted over long distances through cheap Infrastructure(transformer) 
· More evolved , cheap and simple AC technologies for transmission.
But the transmission of energy in AC has its own disadvantages, like:
· Majority of house hold appliances used in current generation works with DC current.
· There is lot of power losses in conversion from AC to DC at various stages.
· Losses in conversion even from the solar panels, where DC converted to AC then connected to 
main supply and again reconverted DC at appliances end.
· Batteries: Batteries store energy only in DC and supply DC. So energy loss happening here 
also from DC -> AC and AC ->DC

->The violent rivalry between Bodo political outfits and gradually emerging non-Bodo political conglomerations is a reflection of the agenda of elite ethnic dominance

With the gunning down of 44 Muslim villagers, including many children, in a matter of 36 hours between May 1 and 2, the Bodoland debacle has now grown into a bigger issue for policymakers, marked by a continuing failure to contain its descent into an ever deeper abyss of violence. The Bodoland Territorial Area District (BTAD) has emerged as one of the most volatile flashpoints of violence in the country with deadly clashes breaking out repeatedly over a mobilisation of identity, territory and resources being linked to claims on political power. The reason for the enduring political failure to prevent the violence lies in the very political-bureaucratic predispositions with which the government has been addressing the complex ethnic and security challenges in the region. With intensified inter-group competition over resources and the subsequent rise of the “son of the soil” doctrine, the escapist measure of the state in “allowing” selective elite dominance in Bodoland was only bound to explode into periodic violence sooner than later.

Behind a political quagmire
The Bodos, who constitute the largest tribal community out of a total of 34 tribal communities in Assam, have been fighting for greater political autonomy since the early decades following independence; this gathered momentum with the organisation of the Plain Tribals Council of Assam (PTCA) in the 1960s and then matured with the demand for a separate State by the All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU) in 1987. According to the 2001 Census, the Scheduled Tribe (ST) population of Assam was 12.41 per cent out of which Bodos are about 40 per cent. But within the BTAD, an area of 27,100 square kilometres (or 35 per cent of Assam), the Bodos constitute less than 30 per cent with no other ethnic group (Assamese speakers, Bengali Muslims, Bengali Hindus, Koch-Rajbongshis) having an absolute majority. The Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) was formed as a special territorial privilege under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution as in the Memorandum of Settlement of February 2003 between the Government of India, the Government of Assam and the Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT). The BTC has 12 electorate members with a reserved Scheduled Tribe seat in the Lok Sabha.

The BTC accord is an official recognition of Bodo political aspirations and promises to “fulfil economic, educational and linguistic aspirations and the preservation of land rights, socio-cultural and ethnic identity of the Bodos” — a special status that the Bodo nationalists claim as their historical due and which others term as a gross violation of equality and democratic rights of the nearly 70 per cent non-Bodo population of the area. This debate needs to come under the lens of history.

In the interest of early colonialism, new reservation policies were introduced to restrain “native” access to valuable forests and to stimulate the clearance of fertile “wastelands” for the setting up of tea estates resulting in an increasingly restrictive regime of “boundaries” that curtailed livelihood options. This colonial enterprise for revenue maximising, also accompanied by schemes like “grow more food,” radically altered western Assam’s demography as a large influx of poor peasants and labourers from Chota Nagpur, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Nepal and Maimansing was engineered in the interest of the colonial economy. Forest reservation policies as well as cross-border migration continued heavily in the first decades of independence. One estimate in the mid-1980s had the tribal population in northwest Assam surrounded by a wealthy forest zone of 3,539.95 sq.km — in formal-judicial terms, more than 80 per cent was inaccessible to them. This entrapment is not only of the community from the resources but is also an entrapment of one community from the other. The fear of all political minorities in Bodoland is a replication of the way the Bodo community was once entrapped (and in many ways continues to be so) which might influence the newly empowered Bodo political elites to create a system that would entrap them. Feelings of relative deprivation through an entrenched minority entrapment could spark off new insurgencies in the BTC/BTAD territory.

In this context, what is significant is growing political assertions by sections of Muslims under banners like The All Bodoland Minority Students’ Union (ABMSU) and ‘Sankhyalagu Aikhya Mancha’ (Minorities United Front). ABMSU has even demanded proportionate employment policies for community numbers and reservation for minority students in medical and engineering colleges in the area. It has also asked political parties to reserve at least three seats for the minorities in those constituencies where they are in an absolute majority.

In a sense, the BTC accord justifies that every community with perceived historical roots in a particular place has a right to delineate that “imagined place” and to protect it from perceived “outsiders.” Riots in the Bodoland area have highlighted increasing valorisation of the “son of the soil” doctrine, a doctrine that is the result of powerfully territorialised (ethnic) identities and the enduring but highly selective reaffirmation of “natural” geo-cultural links between ethnic groups and territory. In such an atmosphere, people of Bangladeshi/East Bengal migrant descent bear the brunt of the anger as they are often seen as fake autochthones acting as Indian citizens/locals.

A safety valve that failed
Bodoland is an example where institutions like the autonomous council (as in the Sixth Schedule) have become de-facto tools of political management used to defuse possible dissent against the state. The government invests in group leaders by distributing substantial financial and coercive resources, allowing some form of local autocracy to consolidate power which is aimed at minimising threats to “national security” and “anti-state” violence, even while creating the conditions for the rise of localised violence and corruption. In fact the choice to negotiate with the BLT in 2003 bilaterally and a significant tolerance of BLT ceasefire violations all seem to have been intended to allow the BLT to consolidate local power. Even the interim body created to oversee the first elections to the BTC was headed by former militants. However, observations about the exercise of special political autonomy often show that it has perpetuated local oligarchies and created new elites, often weakening the links between people and political power.

->Bad monsoon solution
Forecasts by the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum and the India Meteorological Department indicate that the south-west monsoon rainfall may be deficient. Also, there is a possibility of the evolution of an El Niño event during June to September. There is a 45 per cent probability that central, west, north-west and south India will receive below normal rainfall. There is also a 40 per cent chance that eastern States like Odisha, West Bengal, the north-east, and most of Jammu and Kashmir may get normal rains during the south-west monsoon period. Paddy arrivals in the market are also sluggish, indicating that actual production is either lower than the estimated production of 107 million tonnes of rice, or that some of the stocks is being held back in the anticipation of a higher price.

Enhancing water security
In the current scenario of climate change, predictions of extreme weather events are becoming difficult. In March-April this year, we had unexpected hailstorms and heavy rainfall in parts of central and north-west India. Outside India also, most of California is experiencing extreme drought with storage levels in the major reservoirs as well as lakes well below historic levels. Australia experienced what has been described as the Millennium drought which led to the growth of water markets and to renewed emphasis on water security measures.

In India, unlike in the United States and Australia, agriculture is not just a food producing enterprise but also the backbone of the livelihood security of nearly 60 per cent of the population. Therefore, there is no time to relax in the area of taking anticipatory steps to safeguard food, water, energy and livelihood security in rural India, in the event of an erratic monsoon. We should initiate proactive steps immediately to ensure food and drinking water security for not only people but also for the over one billion farm animal population. Aberrations in monsoon behaviour are not uncommon, having been with us throughout our agricultural history. What is new is the difficulty in forecasting caused by factors coming under the generic title, “Climate change.”

The recent report of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change has warned of higher mean temperatures and a rise in sea level if we do not take action on cutting down greenhouse gas emissions. The low carbon pathway of development still remains a topic for academic discussion rather than for political and practical action. International prices of food and other agricultural commodities tend to remain volatile. The right to food enshrined in the National Food Security Act can be implemented only with the help of our farmers, unlike the right to information which can be implemented with the help of files. Right now, the government has enough stock to fulfil the legal obligation of providing 5 kg of wheat, rice or millets per month to nearly 75 per cent of our population. With one widespread drought, the current food stocks may disappear. Even this year, market arrivals of paddy have been as low as 42 per cent in West Bengal, 34 per cent in Bihar and 23 per cent in Odisha. Hence, there is no time to relax in the areas of food production and safe storage

Need for a grain storage policy
Fortunately, we still have a large untapped production reservoir in most foodgrains even with technologies available on the shelf. What is important is the mobilisation of group endeavour among farm families with small holdings in areas such as plant protection, water harvesting and post-harvest technologies. The new government must accord priority to both water security and water use efficiency. Water harvesting in homes, farms and factories must become mandatory. Tamil Nadu has already initiated steps in this direction. The rain-cum-solar energy centre functioning in Chennai is a source of credible public information on rainwater harvesting and solar energy use. Such centres need to be replicated in all our cities, towns and block headquarters.

The latest technologies for using the available water in the most efficient manner possible should be adopted. On fertilizer use efficiency, there are technologies such as those developed by the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) in the U.S. which can help improve the efficiency of urea use by about 50 per cent. Methods of managing the triple alliance of pests, pathogens and weeds must be popularised.

Besides causing food and water shortage, deficient rainfall adds to the problem of energy shortage. In every calamity lies an opportunity for progress. Harvesting of the sun in homes, offices, fields and factories should also become mandatory; it can help increase energy supply in rural and urban areas. At the post-harvest stage, a national grain storage policy with these three components must be adopted — we should promote the use of small storage bins, like the Pusa Bin, at the farm level. Second, we should implement the rural godown scheme for safe storage of foodgrains and perishable commodities at the village level. Such a rural godown scheme was introduced as early as 1979, but the programme has yet to take off in a manner that can make a difference to preventing the loss of food items at the village/block levels. Third, we should establish a national grid of ultramodern foodgrain silos in at least 50 locations in the country, each capable of storing about a million tonnes. Unfortunately, there is still a mismatch between production and post-harvest technologies, with producers and consumers unable to get the full benefit of higher production.

For the food and water security of farm animals, we need to earmark potential areas for establishing cattle camps where the animals can be looked after during a drought emergency. These camps should have access to water. A suggestion I had made over three decades ago that we should identify and establish groundwater sanctuaries at appropriate places is yet to be implemented. These are concealed aquifers which should be tapped only when absolutely essential. Like a wildlife sanctuary, they should be protected from exploitation. The establishment of such sanctuaries — at least one each in the 130 agroclimatic zones generally identified in our country — will help us to save precious cattle and other farm animals, both from distress sale and starvation deaths.

Coarse cereals and food security
As the speaker in the “Sardar Patel Memorial lecture” series on All India Radio, which I delivered in 1973, I had suggested that we should develop drought, flood and good weather codes to minimise the adverse impact of unfavourable monsoons and to maximise production in a good monsoon year. The drought code consists of a series of dos and don’ts during deficient rainfall. As in the case of drought and flood codes, seed banks consisting of seeds of alternative crops should be maintained. Seed reserves are as important for crop security as grain reserves are important for food security. For example, during the recent and severe drought in California, it was found that some of the earlier crops like millets had survived with a reasonable yield, while wheat or rice could not withstand the severe drought.

Fortunately in our National Food Security Act, there is provision to procure and supply under the Public Distribution System, local grains like ragi, bajra, jowar and a whole series of minor millets. Since such crops require milling, they have been referred to as coarse cereals. They should be referred to as climate smart nutri cereals. They are now being provided at Rs.1 per kg — an extremely attractive price from the point of view of resource poor consumers. Such underutilised crops are now known to be rich in macro and micronutrients and could help in the fight against protein hunger caused by the deficiency of protein in diets and hidden hunger caused by the deficiency of micronutrients such as iron, iodine, zinc, Vitamin A and Vitamin B. If the Food Security Act is backed by a nutrition literacy movement, the demand for climate smart nutri-cereals will grow. This will help in promoting the cultivation of crops which may do better under drought conditions.

Toward climate smart farming
In each of the major agroclimatic zones, at least two members (a woman and a man) of every panchayat or local body should be trained to be climate risk managers. They can help the rest of the community in implementing the provisions of the proposed drought, flood and good weather codes. The government has recently introduced a national policy on agroforestry. Agroforestry combines the benefits of carbon sequestration and local food security. The inclusion of fertilizer trees in agroforestry systems can help build soil carbon banks.

This year is the International Year of Family Farming. Family farming is both a way of life and a means to livelihood. India has probably the largest number of family farmers. Our aim should be to make every family farm a climate smart farm, equipped with the knowledge and technologies essential to manage the expected El Niño triggered adverse rainfall conditions

->how china outshine india in growth
1978 was the defining year for the chinese as well as for the world, for it witnessed spectacle miraculousness from the chinese side lifting millions of them out of poverty.India did reform 13 years later

Reason:
-Indian multicultural and diverse democracy against china autocracy and linquistic uniformity.
-Multiparty system where new govt gernally undo the policy of previous govt.
-Frequent wars has put a burden on our finances and resources.
-agricultural reforms in a defined manner and land allocated to most
-Labour productivity is china is very high.
-Higher worker participation compared to India where still women not traditional workers
-Ease of doing business has attracted more FDI
-faster growth of capital stock in China
-Higher factory production growt it ease out the movement of labour from agri to other sectors.
-strategic use of exchange rate to continually boom the export

Way for India
-Ease of doing business 
-increase labour productivity and work force participation
-Liberalise FDI norms
-Skill development will increase labour quality
-Focus on Primary education
-Focus on health sector to curb the loosing of man hours.
-Reduce corruption at all level-
-incumbate the entrepreneurship environment.

->Forceful resource acquisition by state
Path of Asian tiger economies:
1. initially Asian Tigers adopted strong state
intervention; so state had extraordinary control over resources such as land,
capital (savings);
2. this helped state to ful fill basic necessities; such as
education, healthcare, housing etc; eg. land could be forcibly acquired to
built infrastructure; savings could be channelized towards social goods.
3. social goods laid foundation for quality human
resources; raising productivity; making exports competitive in global markets.
4. state control on capital ensured that debt was
domestically financed; external dependence was minimum;
5. Now state rebalanced its state-market mix in favour of
liberal trade regime; devalued currency; boosting exports;
6. with opening of capital account; Asian Tigers were
exposed to global funding shocks; culminating into 1997 financial crisis;
Thus it was state intervention which built solid foundation for future
higher growth in Asian Tigers;

->India foreign policy
Foreign policy has rarely mattered in Indian elections, yet one of the biggest challenges the new government in New Delhi will face is in confronting an international system that has felt systematically let down by India over the last few years. The world is hoping — as are India’s impatient and angry young voters — for a quick recovery of India’s self-esteem and a more robust engagement with the international system. The challenges are enormous, and overcoming them will require leadership from the very top. Only a thoughtful, forward-looking and determined Prime Minister — aided by an equally deft External Affairs Minister — can get this task right. New foreign policy architecture is required here — radical reform, not piecemeal incrementalism. Only with all those factors present can India aspire to play the global leadership role it should be playing, and to advance its interests in a turbulent world.

Footnotes in poll manifestoes
Unfortunately, in all the party manifestoes released so far, the weakest sections are on foreign policy. Most parties merely repeat the homilies and ideological positions of the past. The Congress manifesto, for instance, says: “We will continue to support the goodwill nurtured for decades amongst socialist countries”––a sentence that might have been crafted in the 1960s, 1970s or 1980, but which makes no sense today. The BJP seeks to blend, not very coherently, soft power: the task of “reviving” Brand India (on the strength of Tradition, Talent, Tourism, Trade and Technology) with the suggestion of a muscular foreign policy (“…where required we will not hesitate from taking strong stand and steps”). The CPI (M) will have “India join the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation as a full member,” except that membership is not India’s by right, but subject to the decision of the existing members in the council of heads of states. The Aam Aadmi Party wants to recover “Sino-Indian civilizational exchange” — whatever that means. And the Trinamool Congress believes that the world is “one single family,” but that national security is “upper most.” Unlike political parties and shoddy manifestoes, the new government of India will not have the luxury of engaging with a make-believe world. It will need to act with immediacy on at least three fronts.

First, craft a vision for India in Asia in what is undoubtedly an Asian century.

Our continent is being defined and redefined over time. Regions are shaped, after all, as much by powerful nations seeking to advance their interests as by any objective reality. But whatever nomenclature we adopt, and whatever definition we accept, we are faced with, as Evan A. Feigenbaum and Robert A. Manning put it, two Asias: “There is ‘Economic Asia,’ the Dr. Jekyll — a dynamic, integrated Asia with 53 per cent of its trade now being conducted within the region itself, and a U.S.$19 trillion regional economy that has become an engine of global growth. And then there is ‘Security Asia’, the veritable Mr. Hyde — a dysfunctional region of mistrustful powers, prone to nationalism and irredentism, escalating their territorial disputes over tiny rocks and shoals, and arming for conflict.”

For a vision in the Asian century
As the Asian Development Bank put it, by nearly doubling its share of global gross domestic product (GDP) to 52 per cent by 2050, Asia would regain the dominant economic position it held some 300 years ago, before the Industrial Revolution. And yet, as many have pointed out, Asia “is beset by inter-state rivalries that resemble 19th century Europe,” as well [as] the new challenges of the 21st century, including environmental catastrophes and natural disasters, climate change, terrorism, cyber security and maritime issues. This is compounded by an increasingly assertive China with a leadership that has abandoned Deng Xiaoping’s 24-Character Strategy: Observe calmly; secure our position; cope with affairs calmly; hide our capacities and bide our time; maintain a low profile; and never claim leadership. The Chinese no longer want merely to observe, or to hide their capabilities, but may well use 2014 to announce their arrival as leaders by teaching Shinzo¯ Abe’s Japan a lesson. Do we have a strategy for coping with such a hegemonic and potentially belligerent China? Do we have a clear alternative vision of Asian stability and the security architecture needed to support it? And do we have the instruments, together with like-minded Asian states and perhaps the United States, to ensure a balance in Asia?

Even middle powers like Australia have developed a comprehensive understanding of their place in today’s Asia. Surely, the first task of the new government must be to develop a vision for India in the Asian century. This will require deep consultation both within the government and outside it. Indeed, the most interesting alternative insights can often be found outside government. The most thoughtful recent commentary on Asia, for example, is Pankaj Mishra’s brilliant From the Ruins of Empire: The Revolt Against the West and the Remaking of Asia. Mr. Mishra describes how three 19th century thinkers, the Persian Jamal-al Din al-Afghani, Liang Qichao from China and India’s Rabindranath Tagore, navigated through eastern tradition and the western onslaught to think in new, creative ways about striking a balance and finding harmony. In many ways, these ideas remain relevant today: if Asia merely mimics the West in its quest for economic growth and conspicuous consumption, and the attendant conflict over economic resources and military prowess, the “revenge of the East” in the Asian century and “all its victories” will remain “ truly Pyrrhic.”

Second, develop a comprehensive strategy for integrating South Asia. Consider this conundrum. India’s military and economic prowess is greater than ever before, yet India’s ability to shape and influence the principal countries in South Asia is less than it was, say, 30 years ago. An unstable Nepal with widespread anti-India sentiment, a triumphalist Sri Lanka where Sinhalese chauvinism is showing no signs of accommodating the legitimate aspirations of the Tamils, a chaotic Pakistan, which is unwilling even to reassure New Delhi on future terrorist strikes, and, potentially, an anarchic Afghanistan are only symptomatic of a region that is being pulled in different directions.

Do we not need a long-term strategic vision for South Asia? Will India really be taken seriously as a global player if it is unable to settle its own neighbourhood? The present government’s South Asia policy, based on five principles — bilateralism, non-reciprocity, non-interference, economic integration and irrelevance of borders — failed because it lacked effective political will, instruments and expertise. The new government must do better and devise a comprehensive 10-year action plan for the region.

Restructuring South Block
Finally, empower the Foreign Secretary and restructure the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MEA&FT). Over the last few years, the position of the Foreign Secretary has been emasculated even while the MEA, serviced primarily by the officers of the Indian Foreign Service, has become an increasingly anachronistic institution. The growing global emphasis on economics and trade must be reflected in the structure and nomenclature of the MEA. India is lucky that, in the present Foreign Secretary, we have one of the wisest Indian diplomats, who will be able implement the change that is needed if there is clear political direction.

The Indian Foreign Service was created on the eve of India’s independence; its first officers, drawn from the Indian Civil Service, were rich in experience and had served in various departments and in different parts of India. For instance, Sir Girija Shankar Bajpai — the first Secretary General of the MEA — had been Secretary of Education, Lands and Health when he was in his 30s. The first Foreign Secretary, K.P.S. Menon, had been Dewan of Bharatpur. The fifth Foreign Secretary, Y.D. Gundevia’s masterly memoir, Outside the Archives, reveals the energy, dynamism and wisdom of a remarkably collegial MEA in those heady years after independence — led, of course, by the vision (as well as the personal and non-hierarchical touch) of Jawaharlal Nehru, who remained External Affairs Minister throughout his tenure as Prime Minister. On one occasion, Nehru, deeply allergic to protocol, dragged Gundevia, then a junior officer (in shorts and chappals and a white bush shirt preparing for a swim at Delhi Gymkhana), to the airport to receive the then Burmese Prime Minister!

Even today, the IFS has some of the most talented and hard-working diplomats of any country in the world, but they are overstretched, too often lacking the expertise needed to negotiate effectively on complex contemporary issues and confined in protocol silos which are out of tune with contemporary realities. India’s foreign policy must be seen as a shared partnership across departments within the government of India, and academia and think tanks outside the traditional corridors of power. The Task Force on National Security, chaired by Mr. Naresh Chandra, is believed to have pointed out correctly that the IFS does not have enough diplomats to “anticipate, analyse and act on contemporary challenges.” To increase its strength and improve its expertise the MEA must allow, to begin with, secondments from other all India and Central services and the armed forces. A new political-military affairs division should be created within the MEA (not in the MoD as suggested by the Naresh Chandra task force) with officers from the services and intelligence agencies serving it. The new emphasis on trade must mean that a dedicated trade expert should be attached to most Indian missions.

Let us face it, with an unsettled neighbourhood, an increasingly aggressive China and a politically weak and ambivalent Obama-led United States of America, India’s external environment is defined by uncertainty. Without a major transformation in the style and substance of our foreign policy, “the India story” — already fading in the global imagination — will be viewed as a fantasy.

->India Sterlization + IConfPublic_Development_ICPD
India is a signatory to an agreement at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in 1994 
-called for a reproductive health and rights approach rather than a “population control” approach,
- In keeping with the ICPD, India changed its family planning programme in 1996 to a target-free approach

in contrast to ICPD
-India continued to punish citizens who had more than the approved number of children by denying them the right to contest elections to local bodies in some states
-The shortage of doctors leads to large numbers of women being operated upon within a short time in “camps” that are often organised in non-hospital settings in peripheral areas

-a writ petition was filed in the Supreme Court (Ramakant Rai and Healthwatch UP vs Union of India). The court issued orders to the government in 2005, based on which quality standards were reviewed, quality assurance committees mandated in each district and insurance coverage set up for female sterilisation acceptors by 2006. Each woman who came for sterilisation was meant to sign a consent form read out to her if she was not literate, and informed about the insurance coverage in case of adverse effects. All sterilisation acceptors are entitled to a certificate in case they need to claim compensation
-Bilaspur sterilisation camps
- Women continue to be the focus of all drives for small families, although terminal methods for women involve opening the abdomen, and vasectomies performed upon men would be much safer and lead to far less discomfort
-almost 98 per cent sterilisations performed upon women
-Sterilisation targets continue to exist for female sterilisation

-The GNLA’s patently unrealistic demand has been for the creation of a separate state of Garoland

-Garo Hills Autonomous District Council (GHADC). An agreement signed in New Delhi on September 24 in the presence of Home Minister Rajnath Singh and State Chief Minister Mukul Sangma — that the GNLA opposed
- laid the ground for the disbanding by next month of the ANVC and ANVC (B) [Achik National Volunteer Council (ANVC)]

-agreement, which provides for enhanced autonomy for an expanded GHADC — elections to its current number of 29 seats are due to take place early in 2015 — goes some way in meeting regional aspirations
-The Centre has agreed to extend a special package for the socio-economic and educational development of the area and the rehabilitation of surrendering militants

What else can be done
-nexus between politicians and militants to gain political mileage — as has often been alleged by some leaders — should be rooted out,
-Other militant should also be forced to tgive up arms.
-Security op should be stepeed out to get away with these hate mongers

->Judicially accountability bill
The procedure of selection of High Court judges by inviting applications through notifications which is followed in the United Kingdom may well be adopted in India so that transparency in the appointment is achieved, eliminating the charge of discrimination


The Constitution (One Hundred And Twentieth Amendment) Bill 2013 was passed by the Rajya Sabha on September 5, 2013. It seeks to replace the collegium model of judicial appointments with a Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC).



-The Bill gives JAC the powers to appoint judges to the Supreme Court and the High Court.
-The said Bill introduced a new Article 124-A to constitute a JAC to make recommendations with respect to the appointment of judges of the higher judiciary. 
-Does not define who the members of the JAC are but leaves this for Parliament to determine in an ordinary Statute. 

- provides that JAC will comprise six members, i.e. the Chief Justice of India, two most senior judges of the Supreme Court, the Law Minister and “two eminent persons.” 


The two eminent persons are supposed to be appointed by a collegium comprising the Prime Minister, the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Chief Justice of India. 

-the composition of JAC is in the hands of Parliament. To change the composition of JAC, a Parliamentary Statute is enough which is more flexible than an amendment of the Constitution.


For a representational judiciary

-To be passed in Rajya Sabha
-In lokh sabh
-half of the states
-Assent of president



The U.K. example

They may also consider putting into practice, the procedure whereby members of the Bar who are eligible for being appointed as a Judge of the High Court apply for Judgeship through a “Public Notification.” Such a practice is in vogue in the United Kingdom.

In the U.K., the candidates for Judicial Office in courts up to and including High Court level, Tribunals in England and Wales are selected by JAC. The JAC is an executive non-departmental public body sponsored by the Ministry of Justice. 

Membership is drawn from the judiciary, the legal profession, non-legally qualified judicial office-holders and the public. (JAC does not select judges to the U.K. Supreme Court. The U.K. Supreme Court was established on October 1, 2009 and assumed the formal judicial functions of the House of Lords which were removed by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. Judges of the Supreme Court of U.K. are appointed by the Queen by the issue of Letters Patent on the advice of the Prime Minister to whom a name is recommended by a Special Selection Commission. The Prime Minister is required by the Constitutional Reform Act, 2005 to recommend this name to the Queen and not permitted to nominate anyone else.) The Selection by JAC for High Courts, Tribunals is based on merit through fair and open competition from among the widest range of eligible candidates possible. The appointment process is not only clearer but more accountable. The selection process starts when JAC receives a vacancy request from Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service or the Ministry of Justice. Thereafter, it advertises all selection exercises on its website and in the email newsletter. JAC also tailors the application form for each selection exercise and prepares an information pack and the applications are submitted to JAC electronically. Thereafter, the process of shortlisting commences. Candidates are required to identify referees they know personally and professionally. Shortlisted candidates are invited for a selection day for a panel interview, role play interview and presentation, etc. (Role play usually simulates a court or tribunal environment. Candidates are asked to take on the role of judge and respond to a simulated situation.) The technique of situational questioning is also adopted which involves questions concerning a hypothetical situation based on challenging, real-life, job-related occurrences and asks the candidate how they would handle the problem. JAC also carries out consultation as part of each selection exercise as required by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. For High Court selection, the Lord Chief Justice and one other person are consulted. Financial, criminal and professional background checks are carried out. After this exercise, the Commissioners make the final decision on which candidates to recommend to the appropriate authority (Lord Chancellor, Lord Chief Justice or Senior President of Tribunals) for appointment. Thus, the process of appointment of judicial officers in the U.K. is clear, open, fair and accountable.

However, in the present system of appointments to High Court Judges in India, unless the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned or any other senior judge of the High Court recommends the name of a particular practising lawyer, there is no way to get included in the list of prospective candidates.

This system is perceived to be discriminatory because it is inherently impossible for the collegium judges to personally know everything about all the eligible practising members of the Bar. Thus, the procedure of selection by inviting applications through notifications which is followed in the U.K. may well be adopted in India also so that transparency in the appointment of High Court Judges is achieved, eliminating the charge of discrimination

->nOVARTIS_PATENT_INDIA_IP_LAW
No one can attack India’s well-founded Intellectual Property regime as being weak merely because a drug that is claimed to be an invention fails the test of law

India and its intellectual property (IP) laws have been the subject of sharp criticism recently. Now, there is talk of the government invoking emergency provisions with regard to Dasatinib, a cancer drug. The decibel level may go up several notches.

Let us look at our law. The sovereignty of a country includes its power to make laws. Any person who pursues commercial interests in another country must submit himself/herself to the laws of the country. No one can attack our regime as being weak only because his/her invention did not stand up to the test of our legislation. Nor can India be accused of robbing Peter to pay Paul. It sounds romantic, but it is still robbery.

The Novartis case and the Nexavar case of compulsory licence (CL) are what have impelled this attack. Innovation and invention have speeded up in myriad ways in the last few decades and our country had committed itself to the obligations under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Therefore, it was necessary for India to revisit its patent law; in 2005, the Indian Patents Act was amended, Section 3(d) being one of the amendments. It was the basis of the Novartis case.

TRIPS recognises that members have the right to use/adopt measures to protect public health so long as they are consistent with TRIPS. A recent study notes: “Policy makers in developing and developed countries need to base their implementation of intellectual policy rules on these pro-public health and pro-access principles.” The Doha Declaration is an affirmation of the right to use the flexibilities in TRIPS, especially by developing and less developed countries, regarding access to medicine. The language of the Doha Declaration emphasises the importance of implementing and interpreting the TRIPS Agreement in a way that supports public health.

“The TRIPS agreement does not limit the grounds on which compulsory licences can be granted, and does not prevent patent applicants from having to demonstrate enhanced efficacy for their allegedly new and useful inventions. There are many problems affecting access to and rational use of medicines in India but the provisions within the country’s patent laws, if more extensively and properly applied, should help rather than hinder such access. India’s laws and experiences could provide a useful example for low-income and middle-income countries worldwide.”

About patentability, not price
In Novartis, the Supreme Court said that while harmonising the patent law in the country with the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement, India had attempted to balance its obligations under the international treaty and its commitment to protect and promote the public health considerations of people in the country and elsewhere. The ‘thorn in the flesh’ Section 3(d) had been challenged by Novartis before the Madras High Court earlier. But the court upheld its constitutionality and rejected the attack on the grounds of vagueness and arbitrariness. Novartis did not file an appeal against that judgment. Novartis claimed a patent for Gleevec, a cancer drug which was refused. Novartis then appealed to the Supreme Court.

The intellectual property of the inventor lies in the invention which is claimed to be novel, inventive and patentable. The patent is a creature of law by which the state bars public access to that invention for a fixed period. The economic reward from the invention is earned during this time after which it goes to the public domain. Section 3(d) is a test of patentability. With reference to Gleevec, it is enough to know that 3(d) inter alia says that in the absence of evidence of enhancement of known efficacy, the mere discovery of a new form of a new substance is not an invention deserving the grant of patent. Imatinib Mesylate was the known substance and Novartis claimed a patent for its (the substance) beta-crystalline form.

The Supreme Court asked: “Now, when all the pharmacological properties of beta crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate are equally possessed by Imatinib in free base form or its salt, where is the question of the subject product having any enhanced efficacy over the known substance of which it is a new form?” If an invention fails the 3(d) test, it means there was no inventive step. There was no intellectual property in the alleged invention, and nothing that could be stolen. Our lawmakers meant to check any attempt at repetitive patenting or extension of the patent term on spurious grounds, and blocked attempts to keep an invention “evergreen.” If those who attack the Indian patent regime claim that a minor tweaking of chemicals is a giant step forward for an invention, then our legislators begged to differ. The Supreme Court said that it was not ruling that all incremental innovations were non-patentable and that every case would be examined. Our law says that new forms of known substances which do not have enhanced efficacy are in effect advances without real innovation. Therefore, Section 3(d) is actually a catalyst for genuine inventions.

The Supreme Court said that Novartis had attempted to get a patent for a drug which would otherwise not be permissible under our law. Filtering doubtful patents is the strength of our law and not its weakness. The Novartis judgment was not about price but about patentability.

Let us look at the compulsory licence (CL) case, i.e. Bayer vs. NATCO. The mechanism of CL is essentially about balancing patent rights with access to medicine. The words “social and economic welfare,” “public health,” “national emergency” and “public health problems/crises” used in the Act are all pointers to the CL provisions being centred around access to medicine.

A CL is granted subject to three conditions; one of them is about price. The reasonable requirement of the public with regard to the invention should be satisfied. The price at which it is made available should be reasonably affordable. It should be worked in India. A CL may be granted if the answer is a “no” to any of the three conditions. The interpretation of the word “working” by the Controller-General was criticised. It is incorrectly projected that the CL was granted on this score alone. Bayer failed in the other two tests. As far as working is concerned, the question is this: should the inventor manufacture the invention locally or is it sufficient to import it? The Controller held that “working” meant local manufacture to a reasonable extent. The Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) said that “working” could in some cases mean local manufacture entirely, while in others, only importation, and that it would depend on the facts and evidence of each case. “Working” is not defined in the Act. This issue will be settled by the superior courts on review. The power of review by the superior courts is sufficient to show that our law provides for safeguards.

Compulsory licence
Even in the U.S., it is believed that CL would be a beneficial addition to its patent system, would not significantly impact the incentives for innovations, and that, “a compulsory licensing provision would ensure that the American public is adequately supplied with a product. If the patentee is unable to produce enough supply to meet the demand for the product, another producer should be able to license the product to meet the demand.” This is precisely what our law says!

In all these years, there has been only one instance of the grant of compulsory licence. In fact it was refused recently for Dasatinib, the drug that is now in the news. And Section 3(d) has been invoked by our patent office only rarely. If Gleevec was refused a patent, it is only because it failed the test of Indian law. Refusal is not an act of robbery, for it means there was no invention and hence no property in the first place. There is really no case made out for there being a weakness in Indian law. The pharmaceutical industry’s anxiety behind the clamour against Indian law cannot be on account of any inherent weakness in our law, but only because other countries will follow it.

->Palestine_Hamash_fatah_pact
The April 23 decision by Hamas and Fatah, the Palestine Liberation Organisation, to unite with a view to forming a government in five weeks has rightly refocussed attention on the Israel-Palestine issue. The two parties have in effect governed, respectively, Gaza and parts of the West Bank since 2006; each has its own security forces, and tensions have been severe. For example, in the West Bank the Palestinian Authority has cooperated with Israel to arrest and jail members of Hamas and its associate group, the Islamic Jihad. Secondly, the new pact would involve the recognition of Israel within the 1967 borders, the renunciation of violence, and the acceptance of previous Palestinian-Israeli agreements as well as Fatah-Hamas agreements such as those reached in Cairo in 2011 and Doha in 2012. Elections are to be held at least six months after the forthcoming talks, to form a new government. The context, however, remains volatile. Hamas has consistently refused to recognise Israel, and both Fatah and Hamas face internal problems. Mahmoud Abbas, whose status as Fatah leader is at best questionable, may feel he needs a mandate from all Palestinians; for his part, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh faces an economic and political crisis following the Egyptian military junta’s crackdown on Hamas’s ally, the Muslim Brotherhood; Cairo has also blocked off vital supply tunnels into Gaza, and Mr. Haniyeh has little control over militant factions.

The key international reaction, that of the United States, has been predictably one-sided. President Barack Obama, currently brokering talks which have lasted eight months and were due to conclude this week, says the pact is “unhelpful” and calls for a “pause” in the talks. Mr. Obama echoes, less aggressively, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who accuses Fatah of allying with a “murderous terrorist organisation” that wants to destroy Israel. Tel Aviv, however, also says it cannot deal with a divided Palestinian movement. Hamas is the elected ruling party of the Palestinian people, having won the 2006 election, but Israel has suspended the talks. It also continues construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Hamas’s incapacity to control sub-groups will enable Tel Aviv to continue with collective punishment against Gazans for largely ineffective rocket attacks. Furthermore, Mr. Netanyahu insists Israel be recognised as a Jewish state; nothing short of that. The Fatah-Hamas pact may show desperation, but Israel seems to get everything it wants, irrespective of the contradictions therein. The continuing tragedy is that of four million Palestinians, for whom the only country which could make a difference, the U.S., does nothing.

->Recent assam violence info
The killing of over 30 people, most of them Muslim women and children, across Assam’s Bodoland Territorial Area District (BTAD) is a deadly reminder of systematic efforts towards ethnic cleansing that is under way in that area. The National Democratic Front of Boroland (Songbijit), fighting for a “Sovereign Boroland” to be carved out of Assam, remains the natural and principal suspect for the carnage: it was behind the violence between the indigenous ethnic Bodo community and the Urdu-speaking minority community that erupted in July-August 2012, leading to the killing of more than a hundred people and the displacement of about 4.85 lakh. But the difference this time is that the atmosphere has been vitiated seriously in the context of elections. In a manifesto released for Assam in April, the State BJP unit made a potentially incendiary promise that it would identify and expel all illegal immigrants staying in Assam — but with a caveat. It promised to protect Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and members of the Scheduled Castes who have come there from Bangladesh following “religious, political and social persecution”, and not to treat them as illegal migrants. In such a context, it is hardly surprising that oblique and not-so-oblique statements have been made by different political leaders linking the BJP’s stance on such a sensitive topic, and the recrudescence of violence in the BTAD.

The Assam Police have put the blame on the NDFB (Songbijit). Meanwhile, survivors claimed to have identified some of the attackers as surrendered militants of the erstwhile Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT). The Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), formed by former leaders of the BLT, that holds the reins of the Bodoland Territorial Council, is also a coalition partner of the Congress in Assam but has indicated it might team up with the BJP, post-election. Significantly, BPF legislator Pramila Rani Brahma had alleged that its candidate for the Kokrajhar constituency was likely to lose as a majority of Muslims did not vote for him. The constituency has about six lakh Bodo voters, nine lakh non-Bodo voters, and four lakh Muslim voters. Narrow election-related interests have complicated the situation, yet it is important that the investigating agencies are able to identify the culprits and reassure the migrant communities of the safety of their lives and property. Urgent steps are needed to ensure their security and protection. Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi’s government should be held to account for the repeated failure in checking the violence, even as it remains under the cloud of militancy that looms over the State. For a start, the government should initiate a process of vulnerability mapping in areas that could see further trouble down the line.

->Vice Chacellor India
In the Indian system, the Vice Chancellor is the chief executive of the university looking after the administrative as well as the qualitative aspects of education. Thus his responsibilities range from managing admissions and appointing teachers to approving courses and the syllabus.

If a policy can ensure that the best person are in a job, then that particular area would probably have good implementation of any other reform. Thus the Vice Chancellor becomes the lynchpin for any educational reform.

In India Vice Chancellors are appointed by the government. There is however, no policy or any transparent mechanism for the appointment of the VCs. Vice-Chancellorships are handed out as political patronage. Most Vice-Chancellorships act as comfortable sinecures for retired bureaucrats or army officers and while they might be good at administration, they may not understand the education sector. This has a cascading effect on the policy and quality of education.

A proactive VC can work wonders for a university and infuse the university with a sense of purpose and energy. The following steps could be taken to reform the segment:

1. Just as certain conditions have been laid down for appointment as professors or assistant professors in a university, similarly such conditions must also be laid down for the Vice Chancellorship. This should ensure that the VC is a part of the education sector only with a through understanding of the lacunae.

2. Separation of the administrative and qualitative aspects of the VCs job. Thus, the qualitative aspects could be given their due importance.

3. An independent body similar to the Bank Boards Bureau to select Vice Chancellors for universities could also be instituted.
