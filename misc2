India and Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia was the most oil rich nation in the world, currently overtaken by the US. The low cost of producing oil, huge oil reserves, holy places like Mecca and Medina (help it to have it influence on other oil producing gulf nation.) made Saudi Arabia a crucial player in geopolitics and the world economy.
Current role of Saudi Arabia:
1. Saudi Arabia has very good relations with the west. It is a sunni majority country which does not have amicable relations with shia majority Iran. It has supported sunni militants in Iraq and Syria to confront Iran. But with the birth of Islamic State, Saudi Arabia has reconsidered its policy and limiting regional rivalry to thaw Islamic State.
2. Arab Spring was a cause of concern to the monarchical country. So, it supported the minority govt. in Bahrain, and supported the army in Egypt, movements in Turkey and qatar to suppress the Muslim Brotherhood.
along with large welfare programmes ($11b) promised by the King, Sheikh Abdullah
3. The lowering price of oil, along with increased production and the discovery of shale gas caused concern to Saudi Arabia. So, it increased production to further drop oil prices. This makes shale gas ventures nonviable because of their higher cost of production, and also disturbs its rivals like Russia and Iran, who solely depend on oil revenues for their international ventures.
-India’s r-elations with SA have been on the rise since the Delhi declaration in 2006 between the two 
countries
-growing strategic cooperation on oil supply issues, energy exploration and expansion of bilateral trade, which is evident from the fact that SA is currently India's 2nd-lagest source of FDI among the Arab countries

Confronting points:
-> its proximity with PAkistan
-India used to import more oil from Iran than Saudi, but the recent turbulence caused it to diversity its sources.
With the clout Saudi Arabia commands, it is imperative that India emphasize more towards the middle eastern country to counter the situation prevaling in pak and post NATO withdrawl from Afganistan for better regional stability

->Tsunami
Tsunami is a series of tidal wave caused by displacement in large volume of water caused mainly in ocean. A tsunami of high magnitude can cause intense damage to life and economy as happened during Fukushima and Indian Ocean tsunami.

The below factors cause Tsunami-

1. Seismicity/Earthquakes- When crust below the sea abruptly deforms then it transfers massive amount of energy to water which takes form of the surge .This is the cause of Fukushima tsunami

2. Landslides- They displace huge masses in submarine landslides providing energy at a rate more than water body can absorb hence causing tsunami.Landslides can be result of volcanic activity as well. Such tsunami has taken place in Alaska ,Hawai islands

3. Deep Depressions like Tropical Cyclones- They can cause Tsunami due to low atmospheric pressure and swirling winds which can lift water and make it travel with the cyclone. Eg Super Cyclone of 1999

4. Other factors - glacial convulsions, Asteroids and Meteors activity, man made nuclear blasts also have potentials of causing tsunami

5. Volcanic Eruption -  this release energe which can cause mass water displacement.Hawaiin islands and Pacific ring of fire zonal area mostly affected by violent volcanic eruptions.

The Fukushima Tsunami was caused by earthquake in Pacific floor which was built up for 9 years as per the experts.It occurred where Pacific plate sub-ducts beneath North America Plate on which Japan archipelogo rests.

The Indian Ocean Tsunami was caused by the thrust fault where Indian plate subducts under Burma plate

->Vector Born diseases
-Disease spreading micro organism are Spreaded by vector like mosquito
-Example :- Malaria, Dengue, Chikungunya, Japanese Encephalitis (JE), Kala-azar

Press supression by British
-Vernecular press act -> seizure of press if govt find it printing seditious material
->aress of various journalists and opressions
-Section 124A -Against journalist as they can't critcize govt personells directly.
-153A -> criminalize any attempt to contempt of govt of india and create hatred among different classes.

->TAPI gas pipeline
-estimated length - 1600-1700 km
-Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India Pipeline, TAP or TAPI
-Proposed Natural gas pipeline being developed by Asian Development Bank
-
Problem
-Any of 4 state firms (including Indian GAIL) has expertise to lay down and operate cross country pipeline in hostile environment like Afgan and pak.
-Turkmenistan saying its domestic law dont allow giving equity state in pipeline project to external firm and without which no western firm will come forward to create and operate the pipeline


-> In the last 10 years, there has been a massive ad hoc expansion of Central Universities, IITs and Indian Institutes of Management resulting in a shortage of faculty by 40 to 50 per cent

- introduction of the mechanical Academic Performance Indicator (API)-based recruitment and promotions. Rather than ensuring quality, this move has led to the emergence of poor quality journals, 
-

Govt planning:
council of the vice-chancellors of the Central Universities, with the Minister of HRD heading it, has been proposed. In addition, all the Central Universities are to be brought under a common Act, there is to be a common curriculum, a teacher’s recruitment board, transferability of students among these universities and so on

-Good faculty are reluctant to join newer institutions as they lack infrastructure and because many of them are in remote areas.If transfer rule happen if good faculty transferred to weak institute it can demoralize them.
-In an authoritarian system, this can be used to punish teachers by posting them to remote areas
Sending weak academics to good institutions could result in a deterioration of quality

-this might be +Ve and -ver on autonomy of institution

->Western neighbou victim of their own religious and security 
Iran
----
The government support to lebanon revolutionary group Hezbollah; Palestinian terrorist group hamas  and its own creation Islamic revolutionary guard corps and frequent nuclear activities now poses threat to herself through nuclear terrorism of non state factors.

Iraq
----
The prolonged neglect  and persecution of civilian sunnis by the government increased the conflict between shia and shunni as well as arising of ISIS. The helping in re establishment of ISIS by the government and the release of ISIS prisoners by the government in consultant with US now itself proves fatal to the government


Saudi arab
-------*-*
The religious policy used by the government to retain power that resemblance of king to caliphate brings threat to herself on ideological basis that ISIS is also trying to establish caliphate and wants to occupy mecca and medina in saudi arabia.

Turkey
------
The policy taken by government to curtail the civic rights of the kurds; kurdish languages; madrassas; culture etc proves fatal to herself inspuring to birth Kurdish military.

education falls in the
Concurrent List

->-$8.5B project to locally build 6 diesel electric submarine in collaboration with a foreign vendor.
-GOI will invite interested parties for above project.
-this is apart from 6 scorpian submarines that france firm will build under TOT agreement.
-Defence ministry committee has identified 
India gets 70 percent of its arms from abroad
Defect make in india failure
-Firms spurn $15B tender for defence equipments .Reasons below
-> military laid down "impossible" requirements by insisting on technology that only foreign 
manufacturers had
-military doesn't want weapons from Indian firms with no track record in defence manufacturing
- unrealistic quality demands from a military short of planes, tanks and guns
-flexiblity not there to suit domestic vendor. once issued requirement can't be changed if 
changed it is questioned.
-armed forces are reluctant to accept hardware that doesn't have a record in operational conditions



->E Governance
-Being governed by National E governance plan .The National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) has been formulated by the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DEITY) and Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG).
Schemes by union
- Digitalization of land records
-Digital india
-E library
-Passport , income tax , EPF
-National optial fiber networks to connect villages
-E clearance for environment.
-RTI
-UID , Banking
- Direct Benefit Transfer  , PaHal scheme for direct LPG subsidy transfer
-


->Forest Based industry
-Industry which used products obtained from Forest as raw material is called forest based industry.
Example :
Ayurveda and spices,Tea,timber industries, paper industries, gum, tendu/tobacco/bidi making, match, sports good, plywood etc.

Location pattern
-Depends upon location of raw material ,industries like paper pulp are weight loosing industries, it is beneficial for such industries to be near the source of raw material. 
-availability of transport, electricity and market.so many industries away from the forests like the rubber industry in mumbai belt because of its demand in tires and tubes of automobiles.
-
Paper:
Nearness to Consumption centre, Good transport, Availability of raw material which is pulp obtained from soft wood like bamboo, sabai grass, bagasse, straw, waste paper and salal wood. Power supply.
Still Indian paper industries uses traditional way of production because lack of large scale plants. Paper plants are scattered in numbers and are medium scaled hence, lack of innovation and technology.
Gum:
Gum industries collect raw material directly from forest while their processing plants situated near to forest. Mostly tyre companies are also situated near to forest. Sulphur mining for vulcanisation process is also considered.
Tendu leaves/Tobacco/Bidi Industries;
Mostly these is done by tribals which consists of collecting leaves and passing it to tobaco industries. Hence proximity to forest is important.
Match Industries:
soft wood, paper requirement are met by closeness to forest as well as market. But pollutions due to phosphorus and sulfur use is prevalent and in recent news.
Sports Goods:
Mostly situated in Northern India and dependent on Himachal Pradesh, Shimla region for their specific wood requirement from forest. Also cheap labour requirement is met at montane region.
Plywood industries:
Located near to timber industries, because their raw material is low quality woods or discarded wood from bigger timber industries. Also cheap labor is required.

_ve
-locational pattern result in complete loss of specific plant specie from certain area.ex in lower himalaya region teak is found in large no,if all teak using industry are situated in this region all teak will be lost.
- localized clearance forest will also result in degradation of land. 
-will affect fauna of that region which may be highly dependent on specific tree specie.

->Reasons for Auto sector growth:
-Huge Domestic Market
-100% FDI in automobile industry
-Availability of cheap and skilled labours
-Govt incentives to industry as tax waivers
-Good financial network to support the financial deficit
-Fuel Economy - High fuel rate has increase compitition and forced industroy to come up highly efficent products
-Rapid infra development like highways through golden quadilateral
-Huge demand from the defence and argriculture sectors.
-Government support through technology modernization fund.

->Money Laundering:
-Act of converting illegal money to legal money or other assests by various means.Also called Hawala in India
Steps involved in Money Laundering :
1)Placement -  introducing cash into the financial system by some means 
2)Layering - carrying out complex financial transactions to camouflage the illegal source
3)Integration -acquiring wealth generated from the transactions of the illicit funds

Method used
-Round Tripping ->  black money leaves the country through various forms such as inflated
invoices, payments to shell companies and Hawala route, flow to country of origian through FDI
-Participatory notes and GDR.
-Through Shell companies
-Other methods include the transfer of the money to neighbouring countries in small installments, and depositing it in different amounts at different places

tax avoidance:
1. transfer of shares to shell companies based in tax havens such as Cayman Islands, Mauritius by MNCs such as Vodafone to avoid capital gains tax has increased.

2. Stock markets dealings such as allot shares on preferential basis to connected entities; drive up the prices; in this process such investors would exit; shares sold back to original company or related entity at huge profits.

-In 2002, the Parliament of India passed an act called the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. The main objectives of this act are to prevent money-laundering as well as to provide for confiscation of property either derived from or involved in, money-laundering
-The recent effort by SEBI, to suspend the trading companies, indulging in money laundering, is also a positive step in the direction



->NITI Aayog is a move towards cooperative federalism:

1. governing council includes chief ministers of states; more say to states in policy formulations at national level such as five year planning and developmental schemes.
2. increased participation of states in policy implementation aspects; three sub-groups of chief ministers; "for revamping CSS", "skill development", "Swatch Bharat".
3. states to adopt their own approach to handle problems; state constituted special task forces for "poverty alleviation" and "agriculture".
4. PM assured states of more funds from center; more fiscal autonomy.
5. specialized wings of NITI Aayog to suggest remedies to center & states; implementation decision rests with respective govt's.
6) States to get autonomy on deciding which central schemes they want to get implemented in their states.
7) The concept of Team india , including PM and all CM will help to boost the centre image as cooperative partner in states development.

->exploitation and processing of nuclear minerals in India
-Uranium and thorium being used for civil and defense purpose.
-uranium reserves i.e.1-2% of glabal uranium reserves and thorium reserves  25% of global reserves
-Only PSU allowded to mine these two.Uranium corporation of India Limited (UCIL) and  India Rare earths Limited (IREL) for Thorium
- India has got around 2.00lac tonnes of identified uranium reserves mainly concentrated in Thummapalle ,AP (Around 95.00lac tonne) ,Jharkand ,Meghalaya and Rajasthan and at other places in small quantities. In respect of Thorium , mainly available in the monozite sands of East west coast of India.Presently Nuclear Fuel complex (NFC), Hyderabad is developing and processing the uranium and thorium ore to make the usable uranium oxides. The factors that are effecting the the exploitation of nuclear material in India are
1.Land acquisition and rehabiliatation problems in new uranium and thorium found places for establishing the mines
2. Proximity to the drinking water resources
3. In case of coastal belts the issue of reserve forest and environmental issues
4.Public consensus on safety of mining 
5.Availability of viable technology economically and technically.
6.Interference of international bodies like NSG etc.

Recently NFC has discovered a cost effective technology for making weapon grade uranium oxides from uranium reserves of AP


->Cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) headquartered @ california

-China,Russi , Iran,North korea source of cyber attacks on bank, govt agencies . These are supposedd to have an army of cyber attack experts
-Russia and others have been planting malware in the control systems of the United States power grid and other sensitive networks.

-SPE network was hacked by the hacker self-identified as "Guardians of Peace".
-Whole SPE network was hacked , unreleased movies was put on internet
-Executive salaries data, health record , hollywood star personal info data , email dumped on interneet.
-attack was said to be orchestrated by North Korea (officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or DPRK) in retaliation for a Sony comedy, The Interview.
-This film (released post-hack) is about an assassination attempt on Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un

Effects
-Digital network of SPE was ruined without any physical damage
-reputation , vulnerability of people whose info leaked etc.
-SPE may even be liable for lawsuits due to the poor encryption of private data of individuals.

Other attack from the world
-n 1990s US hit Serbia to cripple its air traffic control and facilitate to enable UN bombin on it.
-Iran's nuclear programme was hit by the Stuxnet worm, which targeted industrial control systems in reactors and research institutions for years
-In 2009, an allegedly Chinese operation, "GhostNet" hacked data off government servers in many nations.
-hack of sensitive data of ebay which prompted them to issue message to user to change passwords
-Denail of services =In 2007, Estonia was knocked offline by a coordinated attack, made by at least a million hacked computers, turned into a "zombie army". Russia was blamed, given tensions between Estonia and Russia
->Prone to attack :
-Military infrastructure and equipment is heavily dependent on computers and networks
-Global financial systems which are interlinked
-Power grids are smart. So are airport traffic control
-airline routing systems, railway networks, traffic lights

->Wildlife conservation .

-India's wildlife conversion is based on US model where exclusive zones for predators are created to separate them from human. There has been some improvements from the past but implementation still have many loopholes liskted below :
- social/economy fabric of india is different from Us also Us has large land but india very less land so exclusion part don't get required space.
-Lacks of funds
-Poacing menance still looms large
-Forest guards are not well trained nor equiped with required equipments
-Relocating people from forests and states remove carnivores living outside forest, result in population decrease
-Lack of prey in forest urge animal to come out for food which lacks in 
-Wild life protection act is not well implemented in its spirit.
-No formidable National law or policy to deal with predators living amongst people so, survival of animals are left to the level of tolerance of the people
-highways running in National Parks- They offer great ecological habitat with large areas, but many highways run across the National Parks. Many non-canine animals are night-blind also in front of vehicle headlight the go blind. All vehicles should be banned in such highways during night
-Animal Sanctuaries- Most wildlife sanctuaries are animal specific like for birds, for deers, hence often they get overpopulated and animals venture out for food and prey leading to man-animal conflict
Biosphere Reserves- Biosphere reserves allow limited visits of tourist in buffer area and humans habitat are available. Hence man-animal conflict
-Reserve and Protected Forest- Often small area-wise which offers lesser freedon to animals
- Panchayat and Village Forest or groves- over grazing, wood collection, tendu pata, mahua, dorha picking leads to no privacy for larger animal
-Private Protected Areas- they are maintained by larger enterprise and often allow game hunting.
PESA-1996, FRA-2006 are invading tool used by politicians. So encroachment in forest lands, therefore man-wild life conflicts
Way forward
-People awareness
-Good laws and policy
-Better implementation of act and training for forest guards to stop poaching
 
 
 ->Difference in river regime of himalyan and peninsular india

The Pattern of seasonal flow of water in river is called as River water regime.
The main diff between Himalyan and peninsular river regime is caused by difference in prevailing climate.

1.Nature of Flow:
The Peninsular rivers are seasonal or non perennial and their regimes are monsoonal,whereas Himalayan rivers are perennial and their regimes are monsoonal as well as glacial.
2.Nature of River :
Peninsular rivers have long smaller and fixed course, whereas Himalayan river have long course.
3.Type of drainage :
Peninsular rivers are superimposed and rejuvenated hence resulted into radial and rectangular patterns.
Himalayan rivers are antecedent and consequent and resulted into dendritic patterns.
4.Basins :
Peninsular rivers have small basins and catchment areas, whereas the Himalayan rivers have large basins and catchment areas.
5.Meanders:
Peninsular rivers follow more or less straight course , whereas Himalayan rivers form meanders and often shift their their beds
6. Speed of flow
-HR flow through mountain to steep slope hence more speedy flow of water

->Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act 1996
-Since the laws do not automatically cover the scheduled areas, PESA is law enacted by the Government of India to cover the "Scheduled areas", which are not covered in the 73rd amendment or Panchayati Raj Act 
-enacted on 24 December 1996 to enable Gram Sabhas to self govern their natural resources.
-to provide for the extension of the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution relating to the Panchayats to the Scheduled Areas

Provisions[edit]
-A state legislation on panchayats in the scheduled area should take care of the customs, religious practices and traditional management practices of community resources
-Every village shall contain a grama sabha whose members are included in the electoral list for the panchayats at village level
-Planning and management of minor water bodies are entrusted to the panchayats

->UN security council reforms
Why india in permanent members
-Largest democracy of work with 1.2 b of population
-Biggest contributor in terms of troops in UN peace keeping missions
-3rd largest economy in terms of PPP
-Biggest financial market of the world.

->Benefits to India
- India will get a veto power so able to tailor the UNSC policy to its benefit
-Will be able to counter the china aggression on border effectivvely.
-Will give a upper hand to india in international affair
-India growing power will be offically recognized
-Being largest democracy our inclusing will make UNSC more democratic.
-Being permanent member will increase our bilateral relations with many countries.
- Border disputes , maritime issues may reduced to some extent as compared to present situation
-Better dealt with issues like money laundering , tax evasion , UN funding etc.

But China is opposed to India getting UN seat coz it will go against pak which China don't want and India branding on international stage will put India vis a vis china which can dent China's asia hegomony.


->India-US anti terror co-op
Concerns for Both
1) Growing infludence  of ISIS
2)Cyber terrorism threat
3)Mobilization of youth to radical ideas
4)Suicide attack plans
5)Nuclear terrorism
6)Money laundering activities of terrorists

Co-op on terrorism
-1. 2005 New framework for defense, which has been renewed in 2014. India has conducted more joint exercises with US that with any other country. Also, USA has dethroned Russia as the top weapons supplier
2.An India US counter terrorism cooperation initiative was signed in 2010 to expand the scope of counter terrorism, information sharing and capacity building.
3. The 2014 statement also emphasized the need to bolster cooperation beyond counter terrorist in West Asia and beyond.
4.) Information sharing b/w intelligence agencies like US supplier sensitive info to india after DAvid Headley attack.

Grey Area
- US soft stance on PAK
-US deniying to accept state sponsored terrorism of PAK
-US financial aid to pak which is used by it to upgrade military might.

what else:
-India has large pool of soft engg many of them might be sympathetic to ISIS so co-op required to stop their recruit as isis may use them for cyber attack.

->More demand for 900MHZ (than 1800 MHZ) in Spectrum alloations
-Generally civilian mobile market use 900MHZ and 1800MHZ 
->reasons
-As physics law high frequency has low wavelength so travel less distance. 
-Most of networking and communiaction equipment are readily and cheaply available for 900MHZ
-1800 MHZ standars less evolved so easier to roll out 4G service using 900MHZ standards
--with current license telecom operator can build large consumer base in 900 MHZ for 200 years. Not having alternate license means giving existin consumer base to other operator

Bidding Effect on consumer
->price will be passed to consumer
-Less compitition -> small players can't enter due to high reserve prices
->Higher bidding -> high loans from bank to telecom (so less loan to other sector) -> more chance of defaulter -> NPA increase
-Less penetraion in rural area due to less fund left with operators
-May effect internet penentraion as operator may have financial constraints

->Corporat espionage

->Nature
Corporate by the act of spying tried to get heads on about govt policies and estimation and then same is used to book profit in stock market ,price manipulation of the bids , tackling comptition with PSU through malpractices and to influence govt decision making through bribery in their favour

-implications to nation
-> Tax evasion by corporate
-National security angle w.r.t defence policy leakage
-May influence policy in their favours by bribery
-Revenue loss to exchequer
-PSU at disadvantage side.
-Kill the compitition and hence consumer may have to pay more.
-Information can be used by anti national to impede the growth by manipulating protests etc.


->-Most Indian dances take their themes from rich mythology. Vishnu & Lakshmi, Rama & Sita, Krishna & Radha are all depicted in classical Indian dances
-Divided into Nritta , Nritya and Natya
-Later art evolved brought other distinctions like male(tandava) or powerful, strong, firm aspect, and the female (lasya), soft, flowing and subtle. All this presented as a unified package aimed at creating rasa or the enjoyment of watchin
Religious effect on Indian dance
-All dance forms are structured around the nine rasas or emotions, like hasya(happiness), krodha(anger), bhibasta(disgust), bhaya(fear), shoka(sorrow), viram(courage), karuna(compassiona), adbhuta(wonder) and shanta(serenity). 
All dance forms follow the same hand gestures or hasta mudras for each of these rasas. The dances differ where the local genius has adapted it to local demands and needs.
-classical dances of India are based on the dance-discipline of ancient times and the presentation conforms to rigid rules.
-Indian dances can be classified in traditional and folk dance
->Tandava and lasya dance which directly relate to Shiva and Parvati.
->Many dance form have depiction of RAdha /Krishna love story
->Sattriya dance of Assam was started by a vaishnava saint to promulgate vaishnava path
->Make up in some dances like Kathakali (Kerala dance and drama) has been used to depict two sides of good and evil.
-Kathak has emerged from the epic of story telling which eveloved as dance form and it has bhakti movement effect on it.
-Sufi music led to whole new form of music which was used by dancers
-Bharatnatyam has deep spritual and religious connection.Carving of various pose on temple wall.Evolved from Tamilnadu temples.
-Kuchipudi dance was established by devotee of Lord Krishna based on dream where Krishna asked him to develop a new dance drama form.
-Odissi dance has connection to temples as it was originally performed by groups at temple only.based on Natya shastra

-Bharatnatyam ->
	-originated in Tamil nadu temples
	-reconstructions of Sadir, the art of temple dancers called Devadasis.
	- Lord Shiva is considered the God of this dance form
	-The word Bharatnatyam combines "Bhavam" meaning expression, "ragam" meaning music, "thalam" meaning rhythm and natyam meaning dance.
	-Performer don't have lip movement so don't sing or speaks
-Kathakali - Kerala dance and drama
-Kuchipudi -> A.P -> dance and drama ?
	-Performers sings as well and sometime even speaks
-Kathak -> origin from  Kathakars or storytellers
	-Jaiput/Lucknow/Varanasi gharana , RAigarh is also there but less popular
	-Pure Dance (Nritta)
	-Expressive dance Nritya - here expressions dominate  

Bharata Muni, who wrote the Natya Shastra.




Diff in Bharatnatyam and Kucchipudi
-similarities :

1. both the dances, bharatanatyam and kuchipudi are accompanied by song which is typical carnatic music.
2. kuchipudi and bhartnatyam have many mudras in common with slight differences in expression (abhinaya)
3.both the dances have their origin from south india. kuchipudi from andhra and bharatnatyam from tamilnadu.
4. the accompanying orchestra are similar for both the dances 
5.both use Cross pleat costume

differences :

1. Bharatnatyam is termed the fire dance replicating the inner fire within the human body. On the other hand, Kuchipudi replicates man’s undying desire to unite with God.
2.The main difference lies in the abhinaya. bharatanatyam doesnot have vachikaabhinaya (lip movement) whereas kuchipudi has lip movement, the performer sings while dancing.
3.Bharatnatyam has more sculptured poses whereas Kuchipudi has more rounded poses.
4. kuchipudi involves dancing on copper plate called tarangam, whereas in bharatnatyam no such thing has observed.
5.Bharatanatyam devotes a lot of focus to the "aramandi" position, or half-sit. Kuchipudi dancers do not sit as low to the ground.
6.Bharatanatyam is a solo, lasya type of a dance, which is tender and erotic. Kuchipudi combines lasya and tandav elements, folk and classical shades
7.Bharatanatyam has "Alairppu" a pure dance without any meaning or expression just accompanied by the syllables of the performer and set to the thala(beat), while kuchipudi is devotional dance which leads to salvation to the performer, it is based on Bhagavat Purana


->GST,14th finance commision effect on federalism
-14th Finance commm -> increase state share to 42% of total central govt revenue from existing 32%
-GST-> Propose to do away the multiple centre/state tax structure with a single consistent tax.
-Concept of Team India as proposed by PM is quite forward looking and promising

->Conditions to be taken care
->Capacity building
	-Many state lacks in capicity to effectively used newly allocated funds
-	-Checks and balances to make sure money used properly without leakages
-> IT infrastructure
	-Require to effectively implement the GST
->Centre state cord
	-Since GST will replace staate/centre tax with single tax to better co-or required. State might have financial implications which centre may have to fullfill
->Monitoring
	-Provision to monitor state utilization of funds are state might not have prior experience
->learning from each other
	-Many states which don't have proper infra in place need to learn from prosperous states with good experience in this regard
->Centre acting as fecilitator
->reorg at central ministry to compliment states efforts
->rehaul of the bureaucracy to make them efficent and accountable

->ITBP
-Was raised in 1962 under CRPF act later  in 19994 under ITBP act rules were framed.
-specialized mountain force  to perform duty in high altitude areas.
-Most of these mans are professionally trained mountaineers and skiers.
-

Mandate and Tasks
-Presently deployed on Indian China border from laddakh to Arunachal	
-to keep vigil on NE border and detect and prevent the border voilations
-To stop illegal immigrants,trans border smuggling and crimes. 
-ITBP is trained in combating natural, biological & nuclear disasters.To provide rescue and reliefe operations in case of disastours (EXa : uttrakhand and J&K flood-humantarian face)
-Also provide security cover to VIPS
-Preserve and restore peace in distrubed area
-Provide security to sensitive installations , banks and other institutes.
-Also deployed in "UN peace keeping missions
-Providing security to indian embassay in Kabul , kandhar also
-


ITBP inspire man to put duty before self.The motto of the ITBP "SHAURYA - DRIDATA - KARM NISHTHA" (VALOUR - DETERMINATION - DEVOTION TO DUTY) 


->Plan Non plan Expenditure
-Why this distinction
-> Unplanned expend consist most of govt expenditure
->UP expend is variable in nature like oil subsidy depends on market price of crude
-> Unplanned expend like salary , pension , interest payments etc are very much related to overall economic condition of the country so it require carefull analysis and discussion.
-Have longer goals compared to planned expenditure which is generally in terms of Central Sponsered schems (CSS)
-Efficent spending critical in UP expenditure as they seeks to achieve different goals


Adv of removing distinction
'-> more efficent fiscal consolidation
-Better resource manaement and allocations
-Do away with various delays
-Will simplyfy the govt expenditure process and reduce cost.
-Better mantanence of already buid resources are they maintenance currently comes in UP expendi.

->Terrorism
->_ve of targeting top terror outfits
-After Iraq invasion of US it was assumed terror washed off but it return in face of Abu Bakr Al-Bagdhadi and his gropu IS
-After killing of osama terrorism was supposed to be vanish but ihas not
-Killing of top leadership of Hamas by Israel in mid nineteen but Hamas threat still looming large
-FARC terrorism group in Colombia has simillar story.

WAy forward
-Killing terror ideaology will auto kill it.
-Curb on publication through social media
-Curb to publisize their henious act of terror like beheading as it influence extrem thinking
-Providing employment to stop youngs from joining them.
-Targeting terror camps and recruit mechanism along with top leaders
-boycotting nations with active terror supports at international level.

->regional planning
-Where specific emphasis given on development of particular region. Done through special policy design or by providing more funds.
->Area well taken by planning
- first few plans been sucessfull in developing industry since many of them was lost to pakistan during partition
-Devellopment of irrigation infra
-Focus on education has given encouraging results.
-Improving conditions of backward states like orisa bihar by giving special packages.
-12th plan inclusive growth has really made a difference thorugh schemes like MNREGA
-speical focus to mellinium development goal has seen considerable improvement in many areas.
-Focus on health through NRHM and NRHM has improved condition on ground

->PPP model
-> PPP modle picked up actually during 2000 , pre that it was like
 -> govt used to pull in private players who don't have enough capital but expertise of execution
->Most of the risk was to be born by govt.
->assured return to private player irespective of project performance.
Problem with pre 2K model
-> since govt is major risk taker so private player don't bother about the quality of the delivery
-Project plan was not evaluated fully considering all the risks 
-High chance of political intervention as govt has powers
-Corruption and nepotism
-Project delivery plan not followed properly so unnecessarliy delays.

->Freedom of religion court judgements
-Hindu succession act was passed in 1956 & amended in 2005 to provide inheritance rights of property to women even though hindu book manusamriti denied property rights to women.
-Shah Bano case ,SC allowded compensation to women in case of divorce which was against muslim law

-Denounce the practice of forceful conversion in the name of religion and saying that A 25 dont allow this. as it can effect public order.
-SC ban on some religious sports like bull fights.
- Recent UP example where SC confirmed sacking of employee by UP govt on charge of bigamy under UP govt servant conduct rule.SC ruled that A 25 vouch for religious faith and belief but not religious practice , so polygamy not part of religion.

->Drought prone area prgram
=Region specific plan to develop area from agri pespective where rain is less than 75cm and don't have other reliable water resource.
=measure takens
- supplimenting farmer income along with agri like animal husbandary
-Water harvesting techniques like creating check dams, roof top harvesting , ponds , lakes etc.
-promotion of the dryland crops.

->Agro climate panning was also promoted by planning commision
-promotion of growth of crops naturally suitable for that area
-building capacity of local area and awaring people about the suitable crops.
-Diversifying the income along with other mesure like farm forestory.


->E governance
- use of IT technology to efficently deliver the govt services to the citizens
Limitations in india
- Low internet penetration
-low literacy
-high cost of internet.
-low level of awareness about e gov prjects.
-Lack of computer literacy in  govt officials.
-Lack of cordination b/w various department
-slow rate of modernisation of departments
-Lack of well defined law for internet governance to stop the misuse
-security convernt among the users while sharing details like financial info.

Steps taken by govt
-More departments to come under this
-Launch of digital india esp digital locker on cloud based on aadhar number


->Law comission 253rd report 
-Suggested reforms for economy growth from legal perspective.
-As per world bank report indian is 3rd worst in settling commercial disputes. 
->Below recommendations are made
-parliament should pass The Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts and Commercial Courts Bill, 2015 ACT which will enable
-Setting up commercial benches in H.C to fast track commerical dispute settlement.
-All commercial applications pending with HC should be transferred to commercial division
-These courts will have jurisdiction to hear only case values 1 crore or more. 
-Redefine the term commercial dispute to include  ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, financiers,insurance companies
-Appointment of person of economic expertise  by CJI to these commercial divisions so save the reappeal cost
-Estb. of commercial appealate authority to hear appeal against lower court judgement

Challenges
-No of judges and lawers available
-evaluating the value of case (1 crore or not) depends on various factors.
-


->Age Sex Pyramid for census
-Population pyramid also called age sex pyramid devides pyramid verticaly in to two half
- one is male(on left) and other is female.
-then we devide pyramid horizontaly in to various age group say 0-4, 4-8 ,8-12 and so on. 
-bars are arranged in the form of a pyramid having longer bar at the base representing youngest age group and shorter bar at the apex representing oldest age group
-this gives us an idea about male female ratio in various age group so it will be easy for 
government to make their policies as per the future requirments
-2011 data show gender ration in 0-6 yr group has deterioated.
-The overall shape of the pyramid indicates the potential for future growth like rapid growth , steady growth , zero growth , -ve growth


->Industry location factor
Geographical factor
-Land , raw material, market,power , labour , transport,water availability etc.

non Geographical
-Govt policies, ease of doing business ,banks, power,insurance ,Eco political stability

Cotton industry location factor
-REquire humdi conditions
-REquire high power
-Proximity to market
-Availability of raw cotton (less important these days owing to available transport)

So found in coastal areas of india like Gujrat , Maha , Tamil.But no single factor decide location. Industry location in India and Britain based on different pattern but common factor like labour , policies , powet definately effect the industry location.


->Iran nuclear deal with West
-Iran might seal a birth as talks on with its international interlocuters UN permanent security members and Germany
-After 1 year allow IRan to develop nuclear weapons by putting restrains and inspection on its nuclear installment in return of loosing intl sanctions

Effect on Middle East
-Couldn't go well with Sunni dominated Saudi Arabia/Turkey and Sunni extremist ISIS
-Might also not be liked by Israel.
-May increase the nuclear race in middle east.
-US may seek active involvement of Iran to bring Iraq ,Syria , ISIS in order.


Effect on our neightbour
-May not go well with Pakistan as Pak and Iran have contrary interest in Afganistan. (same interest in Baloch)
-Should Pakistan side with the Saudis and create trouble for Iran? Should it side with China and try opening up trade and gas pipeline routes? Or should it side with the United States in suppressing the largely Sunni Islamist militant groups 
-China may try to milk the economic and energy opportunity being a partner in negotiations
-China also interested in securing its energy supllies and keeping the US tied down.
It purchases hydrocarbons from both Saudi Arabia and Iran, and has supplied them with military equipment and can increase eco ties once sanctions are lifted.


India's Role
-We missed the chance of being interlocuter even after our proximity with both Iran and US so directly totally out of negotiations
-But Iran might want us in business to counter China's effect
-Iran might seek our association to tackle Pak/China in Afgan

IRan is energy house , market , talen , our trading partner,a source of investment so we must put our act together to build a stable regime with IRan.



->Strict KYC policy of RBI
1.) Earlier RBI used not to consider small gap like if bank has achieved 99% KYC completion for customer but now, 100% customers must have KYC norms complete. 

-Failing to which will invite fines which RBI may increase from current limit.

(2.) Operational curbs on bank for not allowing loans of 3 months.

(3.) Branch expansion has to be regulated also.

(4.) Earlier banks used to take any unsolicited money from customer without asking PAN number, now it’s punishable if found.

(5.) Customers who didn’t present identity proof except photos will fall under “Small account” category with only 50,000 deposits as upper limit and total transaction per month 10000 and per yer as 1 lakhs.


->Ajanta Caves Painting

-> Main theme is jataka stories,scenes from the life of Buddha as these caves used to be dwelling place for monks so painting religious in nature.
-depicting the Buddhist art, mostly associated with the Sunga and some of Gupta age
-drawn over many centuries and by artisans beloning to variuos guilds they show great stylistic variation 
->The most striking features of the Ajanta paintings are:

~ Centrality: So that attention is drawn to the most important person is each scene.
~ Contours: Each scene blends into the other, reveals a keen perception of beauty and form.
~ Spontaneous and Unrestrained.
~ Patterns,scrolls, figures of animals, trees and animals have been freely used along with 
graceful figures and mythical beings such as suparnas, garudas,yakshas,gandharvas and apsaras.
-Expression of emotions through hand postures.
-Female figures in distinct hairstyle
-outline with various body colours
-Earlier painting are natural where later on are more sophisticated with blend of style
-The greatness of these paintings lies in thier success in bringing out the philosophy of Budhism in paintings

Acted as inspiration for painting in south and even continuing inspiring the art lovers now.Earned status of world heritage site (total 32 in India)

->-Modern Painting school
The modern school of Indian painting has it's period of ups and downs which reached it's zenith in a completely new form only after second decade of the twentieths century.Some of the important features of the modern painting in India :

1.In the early years of the twentieths century, the Bengal School of painting led by Abanindra Nath Tagore ,the nephew of Rabindra Nath Tagore ,gained prominence but waned after the fourth decade.This art mainly drew it's inspiration from the sprituality and religion .Dieties images were painted .
It was characterised by simple colours and was distinctly nostalgic and romantic.domianat black lines, sense of rhythm and small size paintings
2.Western influence started to make impact on the Indian Art ,especially after the second world war,gaining styles that used Western ideas of composition,perspective and realism to illustrate the Indian theme.
3.the painter depicted greater sense of visual and sensory level,particularly with regard to colour ,the concept of design and structure,texture and in the use of unconventional materials.
4.While the influence was Western, the images reflected the rich tradition of India. Problems and misery of daily life ,folk stories ,ancient kings,visual images of Hindu deities were depicted in the paintings . 
5.Nationalism also found it's place in the images.The Images that inspired the nationalists and freedom fighters were drawn.One such was the image of Bharat Mata depicting a goddess sitting on her lion,holding spear and weapons became the figure of the freedom movement.
6.Art acquired an autonomy of it's own and artist were highly valued .A new genre of art came into being called the Pseudorealism under Devajyoti Ray which depicted regular scenes of the Indian life into fantastic images.


->Painting school
a) The Mughal School of Painting (Words: 114)
it was amalgum of persian and indigeneous style.Captured mostly nature and court scenes
Mughal painting started from Humanyu and developed under Akbar and his successors. They can be classified into two categories: 1. Persian factor is prominent, 2. Portraits.
The former consists of illustration in manuscripts and the latter portraits mounted as album pages. The representation of historical events, typical darbar,wedding scenes show the true character of the Mughal style of painting.
Most significant are Hamza Nama, Razm-Nama or “The Book of War”, Akbar Nama.

Mughal artists were influenced by European subject matter, motifs, and techniques. So, they gradually abandoned the Persian mode of colouring and took to the technique of representing consistent lighting through chiaroscuro. During Jahangir’s time Animal paintings reached new height. Shah Jahan –Nama was also vital work.

b) Basohli School of Painting (Words-110) -Type of Pahari painting (?)
Basholi painting existed in Basholi a tiny state between the rivers of Ravi and Chenab.

Emotional scenes from a text called “Rasamanjari” formed the theme for these paintings, besides the Krishna legend. Paintings are splendidly coloured each colour describing a particular emotion. A Plain background was preferred as that the figures would be prominent. The origin of this school of painting is a subject of debate some attributing it to Rajasthan having much in common with the Rajasthani painting and some saying it has impact of Mughal miniature techniques.
The state of Gular drew inspiration from Basholi painting but developed a style of its own.
It involves use of hot, contrasting colours with bold lines.
c) Kangra School of Painting (Words: ~110)-Earliest form of Pahari painting.
The Kangra school refers to the painting which existed in the Kangra valley and in the adjacent Punjab plains. In Kangra paintings the main theme is the story of Lord Krishna. There are some naturalistic drawings of flowers and fruits but no "Ragamalas". The colour is tender and charming. The eyes of figures are long strokes of the brush as in the Ajanta paintings. The paintings are realisitic and prove that the artists have studied nature.

The Kangra style can be seen in the paintings during the period of Shah Jahan in whose time Molaram, a painter was a descendant of Rajput painters, worked at the Mughal court.



->Black Money:
- Money which is out of tax bracket is called Black Money.

Source
-Corruption
-Illegal activities
-Under invoicing
-under valued Property transactions
-Bribing and kickbacks 

Issues
-Create a shadow economy
-Increase the divide b/w poor and rich
-Deprive govt of its revenues

Steps taken by govt.
-Constitution of SIT to probe the matter
-Double TAx avoidance agreement with various govts.
-Try to make global concensus on issues in international platforms like G20
-Steps like Jan Dhan yojna and DBT to go for cashless economoy .
-Establishment of ED and other acts like FERA/FEMA.

-

->Space Telescope
=Why used in higher elevated area like mountains.
- to aviod the distortion and scattering of the light due to atmosphere and eliminating the problem associated with light pollution resulting in clear and sharp image.
--.light from stars appears less distorted in the thin atmosphere on mountaintops. 
-Mountain offer unobstructed view.

working
-All telescope work on principle of capturing specific light from the broad electromagnetic spectrum (visible light, infrared, x-rays, microwaves etc.) radiation either through reflection or refraction.
-Collect more and more light and converge it to focal point.
-Have two mirrors , one primary mirros concave and other secondary mirror convex.
-Light entering telescope is collected by primary mirror and is reflected to secondary mirror which converge it to sensor.


-where it lacks ground mirrors:
-Space telescopes are not capable of using the larger mirrors often used on earth-bound telescopes, due to the high costs involved in stationing high costs in space
-Maintenance is also on higher side.



->Danger with unsterlized syringes:
1.) Can cause infection in the patient due to transferrable agents like bacteria and virus
2)can transmit blood born virus like Hep B , Hep C and HIV
3) Careless disposal may cuase soil or water polution.
4)Can have negative effect on the health of medical staff.

Alternate 
- Use of auto disposable syringe which get destroyed after 1st use.
-Use of Needle free injector which drive liquid from the nozzle creating high velocity which puncture the skin and deliver the drug below the skin.
-Use of biocapsule made of polymer which can be loaded with drug, placed on infection site  and penentrated into the screen using a shock wave produced by handheld machine. (Developed by Indian insti of science.)
 - with each shock wave a certain %age of drug is penentrated.
 - Dont harm the living cell
 - Effective deliveery of the drug  so reduce net drug consumed. 
 - Shock wave can tear off the biofilm produced by the bacteria around the protein in cell , so make treatment more effective.

-Will help to boost eco trade with the island nations.
-Modi also launched a Coastal Surveillance Radar Project in Seychelles
-MPU with mauritius to upgrade sea and road  connectivity in its outer island.

->PSL
-Govt mandated PSB to give minory quota under PSL as per their population share.So Muslim being consisting 69% of minory will get maximum share of loan.
-Earlier PSL minority specify loan was not reaching much to muslims and christans but was being consumed by other minority like Jain,Sikh,Parsi etc.

-40% of the total banks loan comes under PS lending and out of total PSL 15% mandatory for minority


->69th Amendment act 1991

-Lead to general conflict b/w centre and state and hence _ve effect on growth.
-

+Ve
-Giving all these matters fully in Delhi govt hand might effect functioning of Centre when both ruled by opposite parties.
-Could lead to crisis law and order situation in case of any serious conflict b/w centre and state.

->Climate change effect on ocean
- More ice will melt -> rise in sea level
-Coral bleaching due to change in temparature
-More acidification (carbonic acid is formed) of ocean as dissolved co2 will increase.
-Reducing ice -> low elbido -> more absorbtion -> effect aquatic life food chain
-Increase in ocean temparature will leads to fish and other aquatic live migration
-Drowning wetland - > area of oceans will increase
-Change in temperature may lead to change in ocean current hence overall monsoon pattern.


->Nuclear damage liability act
-Effect on the common man
-> Only operator can sue the supplier not individual victim
-Limit the time to take a claim within 10 years. short considering the long term damage
-Prosecution in case of damage will happen as per Nuclear damage claims commissions and not by civil court.
-The concept of insurance pool which GOI will also make significant contri.public money wasted.
-2610(?) crore is the amount maximum payable liability is not satisfactory considering the kind of damage that may happen.
-The section 17 of CNLD acts specifies that the right to recourse of an operator is not mandatory but merely an enabling clause. This it will prohibit operators to sue suppliers. Thus overall it will make victims more vulnerable to potential accidents.

->TRade Components
1)Export :
 Spices , herbs , tea , pharma medicines , leather ,ore and minerals, foodgrains and other agree products like fruits vegetable etc , jewellary,gems and precious stones, IT services,Handicrafts and carpet

-Govt decision to build port in iran to faciliate trade with Afganistan is good step in right direction.





->High Level Committee for Envirionmental laws
=Suggest speedy clearcne and put envionmental law on dock for delays
-Recommend dispensing with public hearing and consultation with gram sabha for projects with national and strategic importance
-public consultation for other projects include consultation on envrionment , rehab and resettlement and not on project holistic assessment.
-to show good faith in the assesment report of the project promoters [this may have -ve impact if report is later find false]
-Foresht with 70% canopy to given no go zone. rest all open for development
-Overarching Environmental Laws Management Act ( ELMA )to replace the existing 6 environmental laws


->Indina Council of agri research (ICAR)
-Body responsible for education and research in field of agriculture estab 1965
->contri made
-played a key role in green revolution
-Development of high variety seeds for various crops
-dev of drought resistance seeds
-Development of various agri related equipments like auto sprayer , laser and leveller , precious seeder etc.
-Development of tool to enable the gender equality in farm fields  , i.e making it easy for women to works in farm by mean of technology.

->Iran Nuclear programm
-> west is opposed
-Now iran terming it as civilian only but they feat it end up being military. same happen with indian and pak program
-weapon in Iran hand can lend up with terrorist through some proxy country.
-Us fear that it can be detrimental to Israel interests considering the geopolitical 

Approaches to stop
1. Curtailer - curtail the enrichment prog by various sanction and non coperation so that it can't lead to military program . US support this
2. Destroyer : Completely dismantle the nuclear program even if it require to bomb the sites. Israel support his view.

->Global warming on flora an fauna migration
Reason
- Increase in water level force quatic livings to move to other places
-Change in weather 
-Leads to extinction of some species which are replaced by new one.
-shortage/abundance of water due to flodding/drought leads to migration
-Search for adequate food , migration of polar bear is good example here.
-Destruction of habitat due to extreme weather conditions.

Effect on human
-Migration of some species also migrate diseases
-Will force wild animal to come out for prey hunting so man animal conflict
-crop yield in tropical area will come down.
-Due to rate of change of photosynthesis plants and animal biomass production will decrease


->Karst Topography
- formation from the dissolution of soluble rocks including limestone, dolomite and gypsum due to  ground running water.
-characterized by sinkholes, caves, and underground drainage systems
=Essential conditions for formation of Karst Topology:
-high rain to make the rocks soluble
-Relatively thick massive soluble rock, i.e., limestone, dolomite, or chalk.
-Carbonate rocks should be very close to the ground surface
-Lime stones should not be porous and should be highly folded, faulted or fractured.
-If the rock is bedded, the beds should be thin and porous with complex pattern of joint for conducting water through subsurface drainage channel
- Considerable relief so that water is capable of circulation
- well developed underground channel is essential for karst formation.
-Surface drainage: It should not be very steep so that water stays and permeate inside.


->Lithuania in euro zone
-All EU member except British and Denmark has common currency Euro once they have complied with the economic convergence criteria
Lithuania 
-Baltic Nations Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia were captured by USSR against the wishes of native ppl.Now all three are fully westernised by joining NATO , EU and now Euro zone.
-Got independence in 1991 after USSR collapsed
-Recently introduced in Euro currency block

implications
- Will further alienatte the Russia.
-Military excercise of Russia along with border will go down a bit under EU ambit
-Will avoid any crimea like situtation of annexation.
-Will help to integrate its economy within EU members
-Lot Ethnic Russian living in Lithuania can now be better checked for any rebellion dangerous to its unity
-Will increase its presence in iinternational scenario being a part of EU
-Avilability of low cost investment, export opportunity within EU owing to Free trade agree

->2010 Amendment to RPA - 
It added section 20A
to RPA,1951 according to which a citizen of India who is away from the country
for some reasons like work, education,etc. can vote for the constituency listed
in his Indian passport. Earlier only citizens who are “ordinarily” residents of
that area were listed in the electoral role.But person has to be physically present @ voting time.
-SC directly govt to remove this physically present condition. Govt agreed to it to make it through postal ballot.
-MP auto disqualification on convection by any court. earlier they get away by filling appeal in hight court within 3 months.


-expenditure, introduction of NOTA (None of the Above) and declaration of sources
of party funds of amount greater than Rs 20000.
-Ban on exit polls till voting is complete in election (for all phases),Insertion of section 126A
-
-Even if a person is in police custody but as long as his name is entered on the electoral roll he shall not cease to be an elector. The Act amends the definition of "disqualified", it has to be due to conviction for only specified offences and not on any other grounds.
-The original 1951 act states that any individual in police custody is not entitled to vote, which goes against the principle of "not guilty until proven". The amendment rightfully addresses these concerns but has opened up a debate on "certain specified offences" only which can lead to disqualification

->Urban heat island:
-s phenomenon in which average temperature of pockets(both atmosphere and surface) of metropolitian area is higher than that of surrounding towns
=Cause
-Reduced vegetation in urban regions : 
-.Properties of urban materials: concrete roads , pavement etc. also due to it less rain water goes into ground
-Less evaporation rate so less rain
-pollution
-Geometry -> tall building effect amount of radiation received and emitted
-.Human Activities like burning fossil fuel , use of AC etc

=Conseuences
-Impaired air quality :
-Impact on Health- can cause heat related and resipiratory illness
-Excessive heating of water bodies have bad effect on aquatic livings
-May alter the weather conditions due to temp differences like unwanted rain,disturbed wind flow etc.

->Central board for Film certification (CBFC)
-statutory censorship body under the Ministry of I&B
-has a chairperson and members drawn largely from the field of arts, culture etc.
-restriction on article 19 first 4 are prepogative of the state and CBFC may certify the film by evaluating larley from art point of view which leads to conflictss with govt. 

Problem 
-Existence of parllel tribunal with overriding power.
-No strict rule for selection and removal of the members
-Lack of funds/interfrence by ministry
-Member being only from one strata of society not competent to review film from all possible angles

Artical 19 guarantee freedom of speech and expressions owing to below mentioned restrictions :
1) Sovereignty and integrity of India 2) security of India 3) friendly relations with foreign states – of India 4) public order 5) Decency or Morality 6) No contempt of court 7) Defamation or incitement to offence .

Way forward
-Predefined tenure and removal with well laid principal
-appointments should not be politicallly motivated
-Should also have presons from national security , civil society , NGO , sc judges etc.
-proper availbility of funds to run the board
-more co ordination with other ministries like Home Finance etc to make sure national security angle.
-Provision for selecting of rejecting a film with written comments to avoid any undue favour to any film or artist.


->GST
-Will replace all indirect taxed with a uniform tax .

Benefits
-> Easy tax compliance for industry as tax regime will become simple
-Ease of doing business rank will improve to so more foreign investment
-compititive price for consumer
-Export will get a spur as hidden tax will do away.
-inter state movement will be smooth so more integrated domestice market. currently differenct state has different tax regime so high production cost.
-Govt revenue will increase as tax base will widen
-companies in a chain will have to pay tax only on the value-addition. So, the actual tax paid will likely be small and reduce the incentive for evasion.


->Polar Vortex
-polar vertex is a continuous and massive (about 1000km in diameter) cyclone about the Earth’s geographical poles
- The centers of these cyclones are low-pressure zones and are surrounded by the polar high-pressure zones
-The ideal condition is extreme low temparature
- Their cores strengthen in the winter and weaken in summer, primarily due to the presence of high pressure systems in the Eastern or West Pacific during the summers which displaces the cold air from the poles, thereby weakening them.
-
Arctic polar vertex is weaker than antartic
-The Arctic polar vortex is weaker than the one in the Antarctic as the distribution of land masses in the Arctic region gives rise to Rossby waves which cause a breakdown of the vortex
-Now, this breaking up of the vortex in the Artic results in exchange of winds between the poles and the high pressure regions of the mid-latitude.

-in the South Pole, the low temperatures during winters caused the formation of extremely small icy particles which in turn form polar stratospheric clouds(PSCs).condition only in extreme low temp -80C
-The presence of Nitric Acid in these clouds lead to its reaction with the Chlorofluorocarbons to form Chlorine which catalyses the photochemical reaction of Ozone layer.
-During the summer months the UV rays of the sunlight breakup the chlorine molecules into radicals, resulting in massive ozone destruction
-Although this phenomenon is also observed in the Arctic, its impact is much less pronounced due to the greater air exchange in the North Pole
-he shifts in the northern vortex have often caused other problems such as immense lowering of the winter temperatures in countries like the USA and Canda.

->Traditional Water Management methods
-British called indian Hydraulic society due to rick water mangement technique being followed
-Each househould in some way or other used to have rain water harvesting structure which should be restored
-Indus valley civilization has a large interconnectecting tank structure to collect monsoon run off.
- Jhalaras were tanks build soley for religios right. this should be used for festivals like GAnjesh Visarjan
-River were worshiped and polluting them was considered biggest sin we retained first totally ignoring 2nd and even polluted Gangas
-Build water resources involve greate local community particpation.
-Ponds/wells in every village +check dams

->Climate change effects
-On agri and food security
-due to immense heat ; threat to biotic community
-Thread to food chain as less vegitable will be available
-Changed aquatic culture may effect aquatic lives and hence food security
-Change in crop pattern
-Water enchroachment over agri land
-Destruction of crops due to flooding due to ice melting
-smog and pollutants from industrial areas creating acid rain threat to plants
-Intensify EI nino
-Reduce fish production due to decreased zooplanktons

-Costal area
-> submerging of land due to increased water level
-irrigation reduces to intense evaporation in rain fed areas
-cyclonic activity ( due to intense heating of ocean by using green house gases)
-threat to human life in coastal area
-infra structure damange due to cyclone , tsunami etc.

climate change Anthropogenic phenomenaon ?
-distort the natural balance of the ecosystem due to agricultural and technological advancement
-1930's severe drought occurred in the South West Great Plains in the United States and it was described as dust bowl because the farmers enthusiastically uprooted every shrub and tree for cultivation which resulted in this.
-Emission of aerosols causes negative radiating property in clouds. Eg,. Acid rain and the damage to Taj Mahal in Agra
-Runoff's from coastal development and discharges from boats are a source of pollution and also oil spills like in the sunderbans mangroove forest recently has caused much damage to the ecosystem and the marine lif
-The green house gases have also modified the reflective properties of snow and ice it is more likely to be known that more solar radiation is being reflected from the Earth's surface as a result of human activities. This has led to ozone depletion in the Antartic
-Due to global warming there is a increase in sea level rise because of this many islands inhabited by minor population are getting submerged
-Use of chloroflourocarbon caused the ozone layer depletion.
-increase in global temperature due to increase industry level.

->Granaries of the world
-Temperate grasslands of the world are the major exporters(around 47%) of the cereals- wheat, barley, oats etc to the European countries as well as throughout the world, thus known as “Granaries of the world.

Reasons
-LOcation - between 30 dg to 60 dg latitude in the inner part of the continents at both hemisphere and has moderate rainfall and short growing season, thus supports the growth of grass type plants with long root system
-Practice of scientific methods to retain the soil fertility
-Development of communication lead to market integration
-have soils that are nutrient-rich 
-The world's most fertile soils underlie the eastern prairies of the U.S
-Nomadic and pastoral people have been living there since ancient times, and support flourishing animal husbandry.


->Major milestones in Nepal's Peace process are
-Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2006 between government of Nepal and Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) (Maoist) to bring moist into democractic process and do away with decade long violence
-political transition from a constitutional monarch to democratic republic
-23 point agreement agreed to by the political parties of Nepal 
-Conduction of free election in 2007 ensured by international observers.
- CPN (M) formed the interim governmnet.
-Formation of second constituent assembly in 2013 due to the inability of first CA to draft constitution.


issues
-FAce of federal structure , ruling govt want 6-7 states based on geography economic viability , culture etc. Opposition want 10 states( based on ethinicity ?)
-Govt. insisting on passing Constitution by 2/3rd majority voting while opposition demanding the passage of it by consensus only.nicity
-Disagreement over form of government: Prime minister elected by parliament vs elected president by people
-Electoral System: The UCPN(maoist) is in favour of Mixed Multiple Party Representation MMPR system to protect weak sections against the Nepalese congress's demand of first past the post proportional representation syste
-enactment of law to give retrospective effect to persecute war crimes.
-over jurisdiction of SC and constitutional courts

->SAfai Karamchari
=Problems
- Meager wages
-Lack of social security
-Indiscriminaion by society
-Lack of financial benefits like lending
-Unavilabiliy of protective gears and hazardous working condition.
-Heart-related problems, asthma and tuberculosis are common diseases among them

Steps by Govt
-National Safai Karamcharis Finance and Development Corporation (NSKFDC), 1997
	-for socio economy uplift of Safai karmchari and their dependents
	- concessional financial assistance to the SafaiKaramcharis 
	-establishment of income generating projects

-National Scheme of Liberation and Rehabilitation of Scavengers (1992) to provide alternate
employment to the scavengers and their dependents
-The Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition)

->FCI Info

Food Corporation of India, a nodal agency for procurement of food grain and its distribution through public distribution, has not performed to it's expectations.

Deficiencies
-Regional Disparity-FCI storage canters have been concentrated only in green revolution zone.Large part of the eastern India is devoid of FCI storage cneters and weakens the forward and backward linkages
-Lack of Infrastructure-FCI procures more than what it can store.Extra food grain rot in the open because of lack of storage capacities.
-Lack of Monitoring mechanisms-Inefficeint and ineffective monitoring mechanisms have encouraged corruption,pilferage, inefficiency to creep into the administration
-Functional Autonomy-Over centralization curtails the autonomy of FCI and reduces it's efficiency

Measures
-Decentralization in East- Expanding the network of FCI in remote areas of the east
-Institutional reforms-Coupling FCI storage centers with food processing centers,better transport facilities can help it reach big and small farmers alike
-Capacity building-Training it's professionals,corporatizing the FCI management can bring in more efficiency
-Storage only to a predetermined level beyond that food grains should be released in the market thereby helping in taming food inflation
-Separation of the purchasing , storage and marking functionality will bring efficency and professionalism

->US has replaced Russia as our biggest arms supplier

Us concerns
-Food security regime
-IPR issue
-support for Iran, absence from the WTO framework on important issues such as IT services and government procurement

->Indian ocean altantic current diff
The current systems of the Indian Ocean are largely controlled and modified by landmasses and monsoon winds. Normally moving counter-clockwise, in the winter the Indian Ocean current reverses direction due to the seasonal winds of the South Asian Monsoon.

The currents in the northern Indian Ocean change their flow of direction twice a year due to north- east and south – west monsoon winds both are warm currents.

Another two warms counter currents flows is easterly direction from Zanzibar to Sumatra. It disappears due to South West Monsoon Current.

Mozambique Current moves southward, it joins the Aughals current near 30 degree South latitude and moves up to tip of Africa.

Indian oceans currents flowing along the coasts modify their weather conditions in a number of ways. The warm currents, when they reach colder areas, do not allow their temperatures to fall rather they keep them relatively warmer in winter months.

Thus, there is difference between The North Atlantic powerful warm ocean current that continues the Gulf Stream northeast. West of Continental Europe it splits into two major branches. But the gulf stream raises the temperature of Atlantic and Gulf Coastal plains of the USA during summer months and causes intensive heat waves (not in case of Indian Ocean currents).
While, Cold currents lower down the temperature of the affected areas considerably and thus cause snowfall, dense fog, etc.

->Repeal of section 309 of IPC [punishable with simple imprisonment up to one year and/or a fine.]

-In 1994 the Supreme Court not only decriminalised the attempt to suicide but also observed that the ‘right to life’ includes the ‘right to die.
-The court strangely observed that all fundamental rights have positive connotations as well as negative connotations. Thus freedom of speech included right to silence, freedom to do business includes freedom not to do any business. Similarly the right to life includes the right not to live
-In 1996, a five-judge bench headed by Justice J.S. Verma overturned the 1994 decision which brought Section 309 back to life.


Pro
-a person who is attempting suicide is already going through a mental trauma or mental disorder and should not be punished, infact he or she needs support.
-Right to Die is individualistic and conservative where it is considered a private affair which in no way can cause the damage to others but this view has a problem

-ve
-could be misused , ,dowry cases and children for elderly parents
-the repeal would dilute Section 306 dealing with abatement to suicide.,those who drive a person to suicide are criminals and not to be spared.
-Person don't have complete authority over life his family , relative too have a claim as the person may be sole earner in the family
- India has the highest suicide rate in world after China and decriminalising attempt to suicide will only increase this number
-Bihar government urged caution, saying suicide-bombers would no longer be covered and deterred by law
-

The better option is not punish anyone for attempting suicide but the law may be allowed to remain on the statute book as the chances of abuse of its deletion are very high

->Economic wealth of the Indian Ocean's continental wealth includes:
-Oil fields- India can also boast of its Aliabet, Bombay High and KG basin for its oil and Gas reserves.
-2) Placer Deposits – Vitally important, thorium resources in placer sands of Malabar coast are a promise to Nuclear Energy security
3)Tourism -Coral atolls in itself are endowments of nature to tropical shelves
4)Fisheries - Food security of every nation is BIMSTEC is depend on fisheries.
5)Mari-Agriculture- Brackish water Agriculture for Rice is successfully practiced now and thus is a remedy for land shortages
6)Cyclone Mitigation - Mangroves and other plantation helps in mitigating the ugly consequences of storms and storm surges along the heavily populated coastal areas like Mumbai, Chennai
7)Manganese nickel ,cobalt Deep water Nodules which are very important for India quest of growth since nicklel and cobalt is entirely import Dependent
8)Tidal energy in gujrat
9)Natural harbour- Indented coastline of India along with indian ocean is favourable for Natural Harbours 
10)Stratergic Base - Ross islands In Andaman and nicobar islands serve's as India Naval base 


India’s economic security demands that all the sea lanes leading to the Indian Ocean, particularly the Suez Canal and the Straits of Malacca are peaceful and economically vibrant.
